The\nsolution is to use a `Proxy` type instead:\n\n``` purescript\nclass AjaxResponse a where\n  responseType :: Proxy a -> ResponseType\n  fromResponse :: Foreign -> a\n```\n\nWe can now call `responseType (Proxy :: Proxy SomeContentType)` to produce\na `ResponseType` for `SomeContentType` without having to construct some\nempty version of `SomeContentType` first. In situations like this where\nthe `Proxy` type can be statically determined, it is recommended to pull\nout the definition to the top level and make a declaration like:\n\n``` purescript\n_SomeContentType :: Proxy SomeContentType\n_SomeContentType = Proxy\n```\n\nThat way the proxy value can be used as `responseType _SomeContentType`\nfor improved readability. However, this is not always possible, sometimes\nthe type required will be determined by a type variable. As PureScript has\nscoped type variables, we can do things like this:\n\n``` purescript\nmakeRequest :: URL -> ResponseType -> Aff _ Foreign\nmakeRequest = ...\n\nfetchData :: forall a. (AjaxResponse a) => URL -> Aff _ a\nfetchData url = fromResponse <$> makeRequest url (responseType (Proxy :: Proxy a))\n```\n","declarations":[{"children":[{"comments":null,"title":"Proxy","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"dataConstructor"},"sourceSpan":null}],"comments":"Value proxy for kind `*` types.\n","title":"Proxy","fixity":null,"info":{"declType":"data","dataDeclType":"data","typeArguments":[["a",null]]},"sourceSpan":{"start":[52,1],"name":"src/Type/Proxy.purs","end":[55,1]}},{"children":[{"comments":null,"title":"Proxy2","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"dataConstructor"},"sourceSpan":null}],"comments":"Value proxy for kind `* -> *` types.\n","title":"Proxy2","fixity":null,"info":{"declType":"data","dataDeclType":"data","typeArguments":[["a",{"tag":"FunKind","contents":[{"tag":"Star","contents":[]},{"tag":"Star","contents":[]}]}]]},"sourceSpan":{"start":[55,1],"name":"src/Type/Proxy.purs","end":[58,1]}},{"children":[{"comments":null,"title":"Proxy3","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"dataConstructor"},"sourceSpan":null}],"comments":"Value proxy for kind `* -> * -> *` types.\n","title":"Proxy3","fixity":null,"info":{"declType":"data","dataDeclType":"data","typeArguments":[["a",{"tag":"FunKind","contents":[{"tag":"Star","contents":[]},{"tag":"FunKind","contents":[{"tag":"Star","contents":[]},{"tag":"Star","contents":[]}]}]}]]},"sourceSpan":{"start":[58,1],"name":"src/Type/Proxy.purs","end":[58,34]}}]}],"resolvedDependencies":{},"bookmarks":[{"package":null,"item":["Type.Proxy","Proxy"]},{"package":null,"item":["Type.Proxy","Proxy2"]},{"package":null,"item":["Type.Proxy","Proxy3"]}],"version":"1.0.0","github":["purescript","purescript-proxy"],"versionTag":"v1.0.0","compilerVersion":"0.8.5.0"}
