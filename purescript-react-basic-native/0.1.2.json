Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `allowFileAccess`\n       Sets whether the webview allows access to the file system.\n- `allowsInlineMediaPlayback`\n       Determines whether HTML5 videos play inline or use the native\n       full-screen controller. default value false\n       NOTE : \"In order * for video to play inline, not only does\n       this property need to be set to true, but the video element\n       in the HTML document must also include the webkit-playsinline\n       attribute.\"\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether to adjust the content inset for web views that are\n       placed behind a navigation bar, tab bar, or toolbar. The default value\n       is `true`.\n- `bounces`\n       Boolean value that determines whether the web view bounces\n       when it reaches the edge of the content. The default value is `true`.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the web view content is inset from the edges of\n       the scroll view. Defaults to {top: 0, left: 0, bottom: 0, right: 0}.\n- `dataDetectorTypes`\n       Determines the types of data converted to clickable URLs in\n       the web view’s content. By default only phone numbers are detected.\n       You can provide one type or an array of many types.\n       Possible values for `dataDetectorTypes` are:\n       - `'phoneNumber'`\n       - `'link'`\n       - `'address'`\n       - `'calendarEvent'`\n       - `'none'`\n       - `'all'`\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll\n       view decelerates after the user lifts their finger. You may also\n       use string shortcuts \"normal\" and \"fast\" which match the\n       underlying iOS settings for UIScrollViewDecelerationRateNormal\n       and UIScrollViewDecelerationRateFast respectively.\n       - normal: 0.998 - fast: 0.99 (the default for iOS WebView)\n- `domStorageEnabled`\n       Used on Android only, controls whether DOM Storage is enabled\n       or not android\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `injectedJavaScript`\n       Set this to provide JavaScript that will be injected into the web page\n       when the view loads.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `javaScriptEnabled`\n       Used for android only, JS is enabled by default for WebView on iOS\n- `mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction`\n       Determines whether HTML5 audio & videos require the user to tap\n       before they can start playing. The default value is false.\n- `mixedContentMode`\n       Specifies the mixed content mode. i.e WebView will allow a secure origin to load content from any other origin.\n       Possible values for mixedContentMode are:\n       'never' (default) - WebView will not allow a secure origin to load content from an insecure origin.\n       'always' - WebView will allow a secure origin to load content from any other origin, even if that origin is insecure.\n       'compatibility' - WebView will attempt to be compatible with the approach of a modern web browser with regard to mixed content.\n- `nativeConfig`\n       Override the native component used to render the WebView. Enables a custom native\n       WebView which uses the same JavaScript as the original WebView.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onError`\n       Invoked when load fails\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onLoad`\n       Invoked when load finish\n- `onLoadEnd`\n       Invoked when load either succeeds or fails\n- `onLoadStart`\n       Invoked on load start\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMessage`\n       Invoked when window.postMessage is called from WebView.\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onNavigationStateChange`\n       Function that is invoked when the `WebView` loading starts or ends.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onShouldStartLoadWithRequest`\n       Allows custom handling of any webview requests by a JS handler.\n       Return true or false from this method to continue loading the\n       request.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `originWhitelist`\n       List of origin strings to allow being navigated to.\n       The strings allow wildcards and get matched against just the origin (not the full URL).\n       If the user taps to navigate to a new page but the new page is not in this whitelist, the URL will be handled by the OS.\n       The default whitelisted origins are \"http://\" and \"https://\".\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderError`\n       Function that returns a view to show if there's an error.\n- `renderLoading`\n       Function that returns a loading indicator.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `saveFormDataDisabled`\n       Controls whether form autocomplete data should be saved\n- `scalesPageToFit`\n       sets whether the webpage scales to fit the view and the user can change the scale\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       Boolean value that determines whether scrolling is enabled in the\n       `WebView`. The default value is `true`.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `startInLoadingState`\n       Boolean value that forces the `WebView` to show the loading view\n       on the first load.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

`accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label?

These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `initialPage`\n       Index of initial page that should be selected. Use `setPage` method to\n       update the page, and `onPageSelected` to monitor page changes\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default), drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'on-drag', the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onPageScroll`\n       Executed when transitioning between pages (ether because of animation for\n       the requested page change or when user is swiping/dragging between pages)\n       The `event.nativeEvent` object for this callback will carry following data:\n         - position - index of first page from the left that is currently visible\n         - offset - value from range [0,1) describing stage between page transitions.\n           Value x means that (1 - x) fraction of the page at \"position\" index is\n           visible, and x fraction of the next page is visible.\n- `onPageScrollStateChanged`\n       Function called when the page scrolling state has changed.\n       The page scrolling state can be in 3 states:\n       - idle, meaning there is no interaction with the page scroller happening at the time\n       - dragging, meaning there is currently an interaction with the page scroller\n       - settling, meaning that there was an interaction with the page scroller, and the\n          page scroller is now finishing it's closing or opening animation\n- `onPageSelected`\n       This callback will be called once ViewPager finish navigating to selected page\n       (when user swipes between pages). The `event.nativeEvent` object passed to this\n       callback will have following fields:\n         - position - index of page that has been selected\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pageMargin`\n       Blank space to show between pages. This is only visible while scrolling, pages are still\n       edge-to-edge.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If property borderless evaluates to true the ripple will render\n                outside of the view bounds (see native actionbar buttons as an example of that behavior). This background\n                type is available on Android API level 21+\n- `delayLongPress`\n       Delay in ms, from onPressIn, before onLongPress is called.\n- `delayPressIn`\n       Delay in ms, from the start of the touch, before onPressIn is called.\n- `delayPressOut`\n       Delay in ms, from the release of the touch, before onPressOut is called.\n- `disabled`\n       If true, disable all interactions for this component.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* TV preferred focus (see documentation for the View component).\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far your touch can start away from the button.\n       This is added to pressRetentionOffset when moving off of the button.\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits\n       two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onBlur`\n       When `accessible` is true (which is the default) this may be called when\n       the OS-specific concept of \"blur\" occurs, meaning the element lost focus.\n       Some platforms may not have the concept of blur.\n- `onFocus`\n       When `accessible` is true (which is the default) this may be called when\n       the OS-specific concept of \"focus\" occurs. Some platforms may not have\n       the concept of focus.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: {layout: {x, y, width, height}}}\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onPress`\n       Called when the touch is released,\n       but not if cancelled (e.g. by a scroll that steals the responder lock).\n- `pressRetentionOffset`\n       When the scroll view is disabled, this defines how far your\n       touch may move off of the button, before deactivating the button.\n       Once deactivated, try moving it back and you'll see that the button\n       is once again reactivated! Move it back and forth several times\n       while the scroll view is disabled. Ensure you pass in a constant\n       to reduce memory allocations.\n- `style`\n       //FIXME: not in doc but available in examples\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n       enabled: If true, parallax effects are enabled.

`accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `actions`\n       Sets possible actions on the toolbar as part of the action menu. These are displayed as icons\n       or text on the right side of the widget. If they don't fit they are placed in an 'overflow'\n       menu.\n       This property takes an array of objects, where each object has the following keys:\n       * `title`: **required**, the title of this action\n       * `icon`: the icon for this action, e.g. `require('./some_icon.png')`\n       * `show`: when to show this action as an icon or hide it in the overflow menu: `always`,\n       `ifRoom` or `never`\n       * `showWithText`: boolean, whether to show text alongside the icon or not\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentInsetEnd`\n       Sets the content inset for the toolbar ending edge.\n       The content inset affects the valid area for Toolbar content other\n       than the navigation button and menu. Insets define the minimum\n       margin for these components and can be used to effectively align\n       Toolbar content along well-known gridlines.\n- `contentInsetStart`\n       Sets the content inset for the toolbar starting edge.\n       The content inset affects the valid area for Toolbar content\n       other than the navigation button and menu. Insets define the\n       minimum margin for these components and can be used to effectively\n       align Toolbar content along well-known gridlines.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `logo`\n       Sets the toolbar logo.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `navIcon`\n       Sets the navigation icon.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onActionSelected`\n       Callback that is called when an action is selected. The only\n       argument that is passed to the callback is the position of the\n       action in the actions array.\n- `onIconClicked`\n       Callback called when the icon is selected.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `overflowIcon`\n       Sets the overflow icon.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `rtl`\n       Used to set the toolbar direction to RTL.\n       In addition to this property you need to add\n       android:supportsRtl=\"true\"\n       to your application AndroidManifest.xml and then call\n       setLayoutDirection(LayoutDirection.RTL) in your MainActivity\n       onCreate method.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `subtitle`\n       Sets the toolbar subtitle.\n- `subtitleColor`\n       Sets the toolbar subtitle color.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `title`\n       Sets the toolbar title.\n- `titleColor`\n       Sets the toolbar title color.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

`accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `inlineImageLeft`\n       If defined, the provided image resource will be rendered on the left.\n- `inlineImagePadding`\n       Padding between the inline image, if any, and the text input itself.\n- `inputAccessoryViewID`\n       Used to connect to an InputAccessoryView. Not part of react-natives documentation, but present in examples and\n       code.\n       See https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/inputaccessoryview.html for more information.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardAppearance`\n       Determines the color of the keyboard.\n- `keyboardType`\n       enum(\"default\", 'numeric', 'email-address', \"ascii-capable\", 'numbers-and-punctuation', 'url', 'number-pad', 'phone-pad', 'name-phone-pad',\n       'decimal-pad', 'twitter', 'web-search', 'visible-password')\n       Determines which keyboard to open, e.g.numeric.\n       The following values work across platforms: - default - numeric - email-address - phone-pad\n       The following values work on iOS: - ascii-capable - numbers-and-punctuation - url - number-pad - name-phone-pad - decimal-pad - twitter - web-search\n       The following values work on Android: - visible-password\n- `maxFontSizeMultiplier`\n       Specifies largest possible scale a font can reach when allowFontScaling is enabled. Possible values:\n       - null/undefined (default): inherit from the parent node or the global default (0)\n       - 0: no max, ignore parent/global default\n       - >= 1: sets the maxFontSizeMultiplier of this node to this value\n- `maxLength`\n       Limits the maximum number of characters that can be entered.\n       Use this instead of implementing the logic in JS to avoid flicker.\n- `multiline`\n       If true, the text input can be multiple lines. The default value is false.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `numberOfLines`\n       Sets the number of lines for a TextInput.\n       Use it with multiline set to true to be able to fill the lines.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onBlur`\n       Callback that is called when the text input is blurred\n- `onChange`\n       Callback that is called when the text input's text changes.\n- `onChangeText`\n       Callback that is called when the text input's text changes.\n       Changed text is passed as an argument to the callback handler.\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Callback that is called when the text input's content size changes.\n       This will be called with\n       `{ nativeEvent: { contentSize: { width, height } } }`.\n       Only called for multiline text inputs.\n- `onEndEditing`\n       Callback that is called when text input ends.\n- `onFocus`\n       Callback that is called when the text input is focused\n- `onKeyPress`\n       Callback that is called when a key is pressed.\n       This will be called with\n         `{ nativeEvent: { key: keyValue } }`\n       where keyValue is 'Enter' or 'Backspace' for respective keys and the typed-in character otherwise including ' ' for space.\n       Fires before onChange callbacks.\n       Note: on Android only the inputs from soft keyboard are handled, not the hardware keyboard inputs.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Invoked on content scroll with\n         `{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { x, y } } }`.\n       May also contain other properties from ScrollEvent but on Android contentSize is not provided for performance reasons.\n- `onSelectionChange`\n       Callback that is called when the text input selection is changed.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onSubmitEditing`\n       Callback that is called when the text input's submit button is pressed.\n- `placeholder`\n       The string that will be rendered before text input has been entered\n- `placeholderTextColor`\n       The text color of the placeholder string\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `returnKeyLabel`\n       Sets the return key to the label. Use it instead of `returnKeyType`.\n        __*platform* android\n- `returnKeyType`\n       enum('default', 'go', 'google', 'join', 'next', 'route', 'search', 'send', 'yahoo', 'done', 'emergency-call')\n       Determines how the return key should look.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       If false, scrolling of the text view will be disabled. The default value is true. Only works with multiline={true}\n- `secureTextEntry`\n       If true, the text input obscures the text entered so that sensitive text like passwords stay secure.\n       The default value is false.\n- `selectTextOnFocus`\n       If true, all text will automatically be selected on focus\n- `selection`\n       The start and end of the text input's selection. Set start and end to\n       the same value to position the cursor.\n- `selectionColor`\n       The highlight (and cursor on ios) color of the text input\n- `selectionState`\n       See DocumentSelectionState.js, some state that is responsible for maintaining selection information for a document\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `spellCheck`\n       If false, disables spell-check style (i.e. red underlines). The default value is inherited from autoCorrect\n- `style`\n       Styles\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests\n- `textAlignVertical`\n       Vertically align text when `multiline` is set to true\n- `textBreakStrategy`\n       Set text break strategy on Android API Level 23+, possible values are simple, highQuality, balanced\n       The default value is simple.\n- `textContentType`\n       Give the keyboard and the system information about the expected\n       semantic meaning for the content that users enter.\n       For iOS 11+ you can set `textContentType` to `username` or `password` to\n       enable autofill of login details from the device keychain.\n       For iOS 12+ `newPassword` can be used to indicate a new password input the\n       user may want to save in the keychain, and `oneTimeCode` can be used to indicate\n       that a field can be autofilled by a code arriving in an SMS.\n       To disable autofill, set textContentType to `none`.\n       Possible values for `textContentType` are:\n         - `'none'`\n         - `'URL'`\n         - `'addressCity'`\n         - `'addressCityAndState'`\n         - `'addressState'`\n         - `'countryName'`\n         - `'creditCardNumber'`\n         - `'emailAddress'`\n         - `'familyName'`\n         - `'fullStreetAddress'`\n         - `'givenName'`\n         - `'jobTitle'`\n         - `'location'`\n         - `'middleName'`\n         - `'name'`\n         - `'namePrefix'`\n         - `'nameSuffix'`\n         - `'nickname'`\n         - `'organizationName'`\n         - `'postalCode'`\n         - `'streetAddressLine1'`\n         - `'streetAddressLine2'`\n         - `'sublocality'`\n         - `'telephoneNumber'`\n         - `'username'`\n         - `'password'`\n         - `'newPassword'`\n         - `'oneTimeCode'`\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `underlineColorAndroid`\n       The color of the textInput underline.\n- `value`\n       The value to show for the text input. TextInput is a controlled component,\n       which means the native value will be forced to match this value prop if provided.\n       For most uses this works great, but in some cases this may cause flickering - one common cause is preventing edits by keeping value the same.\n       In addition to simply setting the same value, either set editable={false},\n       or set/update maxLength to prevent unwanted edits without flicker.\n","title":"TextInputProps","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityActions",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityComponentType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityElementsHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityHint",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLabel",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLiveRegion",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityRole",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityStates",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityTraits",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityViewIsModal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessible",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["allowFontScaling",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["autoCapitalize",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["autoCompleteType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["autoCorrect",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["autoFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["blurOnSubmit",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["caretHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["clearButtonMode",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["clearTextOnFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["collapsable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contextMenuHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["dataDetectorTypes",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["defaultValue",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["disableFullscreenUI",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["editable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["enablesReturnKeyAutomatically",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hasTVPreferredFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hitSlop",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["importantForAccessibility",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstr

<https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tabbarios.html#props>\n- `accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `barTintColor`\n       Background color of the tab bar\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `itemPositioning`\n       Specifies tab bar item positioning. Available values are:\n       - fill - distributes items across the entire width of the tab bar\n       - center - centers item in the available tab bar space\n       - auto (default) - distributes items dynamically according to the\n       user interface idiom. In a horizontally compact environment (e.g. iPhone 5)\n       this value defaults to `fill`, in a horizontally regular one (e.g. iPad)\n       it defaults to center.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tintColor`\n       Color of the currently selected tab icon\n- `translucent`\n       A Boolean value that indicates whether the tab bar is translucent\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `unselectedItemTintColor`\n       Color of unselected tab icons. Available since iOS 10.\n- `unselectedTintColor`\n       Color of text on unselected tabs\n","title":"TabBarIOSProps","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityActions",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityComponentType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityElementsHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityHint",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLabel",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLiveRegion",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityRole",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityStates",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityTraits",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityViewIsModal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessible",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["barTintColor",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["collapsable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hasTVPreferredFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hitSlop",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["importantForAccessibility",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["isTVSelectable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["itemPositioning",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["nativeID",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onAccessibilityAction",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onAccessibilityTap",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onLayout",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect","Uncurried"],"EffectFn1"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"LayoutChangeEvent"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onMagicTap",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onMoveShouldSe

These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `badge`\n       Little red bubble that sits at the top right of the icon.\n- `badgeColor`\n       Background color for the badge. Available since iOS 10.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `icon`\n       A custom icon for the tab. It is ignored when a system icon is defined.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onPress`\n       Callback when this tab is being selected,\n       you should change the state of your component to set selected={true}.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderAsOriginal`\n       If set to true it renders the image as original,\n       it defaults to being displayed as a template\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `selected`\n       It specifies whether the children are visible or not. If you see a blank content, you probably forgot to add a selected one.\n- `selectedIcon`\n       A custom icon when the tab is selected.\n       It is ignored when a system icon is defined. If left empty, the icon will be tinted in blue.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `style`\n       React style object.\n- `systemIcon`\n       Items comes with a few predefined system icons.\n       Note that if you are using them, the title and selectedIcon will be overriden with the system ones.\n         enum('bookmarks', 'contacts', 'downloads', 'favorites', 'featured', 'history', 'more', 'most-recent', 'most-viewed', 'recents', 'search', 'top-rated')\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `title`\n       Text that appears under the icon. It is ignored when a system icon is defined.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `ios_backgroundColor`\n       On iOS, custom color for the background.\n       Can be seen when the switch value is false or when the switch is disabled.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onTintColor`\n       Background color when the switch is turned on.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Invoked with the new value when the value changes.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `thumbColor`\n       Color of the foreground switch grip.\n- `thumbTintColor`\n       Color of the foreground switch grip.\n- `tintColor`\n       Background color when the switch is turned off.\n- `trackColor`\n       Custom colors for the switch track\n       Color when false and color when true\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onTintColor`\n       Background color when the switch is turned on.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Callback that is called when the user toggles the switch.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `thumbTintColor`\n       Background color for the switch round button.\n- `tintColor`\n       Background color when the switch is turned off.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `value`\n       The value of the switch, if true the switch will be turned on.

See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label?

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `maximumTrackImage`\n       Assigns a maximum track image.

Only static images are supported.\n       The rightmost pixel of the image will be stretched to fill the track.\n- `minimumTrackTintColor`\n       The color used for the track to the left of the button.\n       Overrides the default blue gradient image.\n- `minimumValue`\n       Initial minimum value of the slider. Default value is 0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onSlidingComplete`\n       Callback called when the user finishes changing the value (e.g. when the slider is released).\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Callback continuously called while the user is dragging the slider.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `step`\n       Step value of the slider. The value should be between 0 and (maximumValue - minimumValue). Default value is 0.\n- `style`\n       Used to style and layout the Slider. See StyleSheet.js and ViewStylePropTypes.js for more info.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in UI automation tests.\n- `thumbImage`\n       Sets an image for the thumb. Only static images are supported.\n- `thumbTintColor`\n       Color of the foreground switch grip.\n- `trackImage`\n       Assigns a single image for the track. Only static images\n       are supported. The center pixel of the image will be stretched\n       to fill the track.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `value`\n       Initial value of the slider. The value should be between minimumValue\n       and maximumValue, which default to 0 and 1 respectively.\n       Default value is 0.\n       This is not a controlled component, you don't need to update\n       the value during dragging.\n","title":"SliderProps","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityActions",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityComponentType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityElementsHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityHint",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLabel",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLiveRegion",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityRole",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityStates",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityTraits",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityViewIsModal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessible",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["collapsable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["disabled",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hasTVPreferredFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hitSlop",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["importantForAccessibility",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["isTVSelectable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["maximumTrackImage",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"ImageURISource"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["maximumTrackTintColor",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["maximumValue",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Number"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["minimumTrackImage",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"ImageURISource"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["minimumTrackTintColor",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["minimumValue",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Number"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["nativeID",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onAccessibilityAction",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onAccessibilityTap",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onLayout",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInTyp

See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `momentary`\n       If true, then selecting a segment won't persist visually.\n       The onValueChange callback will still work as expected.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onChange`\n       Callback that is called when the user taps a segment;\n       passes the event as an argument\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Callback that is called when the user taps a segment; passes the segment's value as an argument\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `selectedIndex`\n       The index in props.values of the segment to be (pre)selected.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tintColor`\n       Accent color of the control.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row\n       instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       Experimental: When true offscreen child views (whose `overflow` value is\n       `hidden`) are removed from their native backing superview when offscreen.\n       This canimprove scrolling performance on long lists. The default value is\n       false.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onRefresh`\n       Called when the view starts refreshing.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progressBackgroundColor`\n       The background color of the refresh indicator.\n- `progressViewOffset`\n       Progress view top offset\n        __*platform* android\n- `refreshing`\n       Whether the view should be indicating an active refresh.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `size`\n       Size of the refresh indicator, see RefreshControl.SIZE.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tintColor`\n       The color of the refresh indicator.\n- `title`\n       The title displayed under the refresh indicator.\n- `titleColor`\n       Title color.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `colors`\n       The colors (at least one) that will be used to draw the refresh indicator.\n- `enabled`\n       Whether the pull to refresh functionality is enabled.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onRefresh`\n       Called when the view starts refreshing.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progressBackgroundColor`\n       The background color of the refresh indicator.\n- `progressViewOffset`\n       Progress view top offset\n        __*platform* android\n- `refreshing`\n       Whether the view should be indicating an active refresh.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `size`\n       Size of the refresh indicator, see RefreshControl.SIZE.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tintColor`\n       The color of the refresh indicator.\n- `title`\n       The title displayed under the refresh indicator.\n- `titleColor`\n       Title color.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

`accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row\n       instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       Experimental: When true offscreen child views (whose `overflow` value is\n       `hidden`) are removed from their native backing superview when offscreen.\n       This canimprove scrolling performance on long lists. The default value is\n       false.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `zoomScale`\n       The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.\n","title":"RecyclerViewBackedScrollViewProps","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityActions",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityComponentType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityElementsHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityHint",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLabel",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLiveRegion",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityRole",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityStates",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityTraits",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityViewIsModal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessible",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["alwaysBounceHorizontal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["alwaysBounceVertical",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["automaticallyAdjustContentInsets",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["bounces",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["bouncesZoom",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["canCancelContentTouches",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["centerContent",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["collapsable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentContainerStyle",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","DOM","Internal"],"CSS"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentInset",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentOffset",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"PointPropType"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["decelerationRate",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["directionalLockEnabled",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["endFillColor",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hasTVPreferredFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hitSlop",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["horizontal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["importantForAccessibility",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Pr

<https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/progressviewios.html>\n __*see* ProgressViewIOS.ios.js\n- `accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progress`\n       The progress value (between 0 and 1).\n- `progressImage`\n       A stretchable image to display as the progress bar.\n- `progressTintColor`\n       The tint color of the progress bar itself.\n- `progressViewStyle`\n       The progress bar style.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `trackImage`\n       A stretchable image to display behind the progress bar.\n- `trackTintColor`\n       The tint color of the progress bar track.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `color`\n       Color of the progress bar.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indeterminate`\n       If the progress bar will show indeterminate progress.\n       Note that this can only be false if styleAttr is Horizontal.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progress`\n       The progress value (between 0 and 1).\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `styleAttr`\n       Style of the ProgressBar. One of:\n          Horizontal\n          Normal (default)\n          Small\n          Large\n          Inverse\n          SmallInverse\n          LargeInverse\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `enabled`\n       If set to false, the picker will be disabled, i.e. the user will not be able to make a\n       selection.\n        __*platform* android\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `itemStyle`\n       Style to apply to each of the item labels.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `mode`\n       On Android, specifies how to display the selection items when the user taps on the picker:\n          - 'dialog': Show a modal dialog. This is the default.\n          - 'dropdown': Shows a dropdown anchored to the picker view\n        __*platform* android\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Callback for when an item is selected. This is called with the\n       following parameters:\n       - itemValue: the value prop of the item that was selected\n       - itemPosition: the index of the selected item in this picker\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `prompt`\n       Prompt string for this picker, used on Android in dialog mode as the title of the dialog.\n        __*platform* android\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `selectedValue`\n       Value matching value of one of the items.\n       Can be a string or an integer.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `testId`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

__*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

<https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/listview.html#props>\n- `accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `dataSource`\n       An instance of [ListView.DataSource](docs/listviewdatasource.html) to use\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `enableEmptySections`\n       Flag indicating whether empty section headers should be rendered.\n       In the future release empty section headers will be rendered by\n       default, and the flag will be deprecated. If empty sections are not\n       desired to be rendered their indices should be excluded from\n       sectionID object.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row\n       instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `initialListSize`\n       How many rows to render on initial component mount.  Use this to make\n       it so that the first screen worth of data apears at one time instead of\n       over the course of multiple frames.\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onChangeVisibleRows`\n       (visibleRows, changedRows) => void\n       Called when the set of visible rows changes.  `visibleRows` maps\n       { sectionID: { rowID: true }} for all the visible rows, and\n       `changedRows` maps { sectionID: { rowID: true | false }} for the rows\n       that have changed their visibility, with true indicating visible, and\n       false indicating the view has moved out of view.\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onEndReached`\n       Called when all rows have been rendered and the list has been scrolled\n       to within onEndReachedThreshold of the bottom.  The native scroll\n       event is provided.\n- `onEndReachedThreshold`\n       Threshold in pixels for onEndReached.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pageSize`\n       Number of rows to render per event loop.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       A performance optimization for improving scroll perf of\n       large lists, used in conjunction with overflow: 'hidden' on the row\n       containers.  Use at your own risk.\n- `renderFooter`\n       () => renderable\n       The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)\n       on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them\n       in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always\n       at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.\n- `renderHeader`\n       () => renderable\n       The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)\n       on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them\n       in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always\n       at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.\n- `renderRow`\n       (rowData, sectionID, rowID) => renderable\n       Takes a data entry from the data source and its ids and should return\n       a renderable component to be rendered as the row.  By default the data\n       is exactly what was put into the data source, but it's also possible to\n       provide custom extractors.\n- `renderScrollComponent`\n       A function that returns the scrollable component in which the list rows are rendered.\n       Defaults to returning a ScrollView with the given props.\n- `renderSectionHeader`\n       (sectionData, sectionID) => renderable\n       If provided, a sticky header is rendered for this section.  The sticky\n       behavior means that it will scroll with the content at the top of the\n       section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it will\n       stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section\n       header.\n- `renderSeparator`\n       (sectionID, rowID, adjacentRowHighlighted) => renderable\n       If provided, a renderable component to be rendered as the separator below each row\n       but not the last row if there is a section header below.\n       Take a sectionID and rowID of the row above and whether its adjacent row is highlighted.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollRenderAheadDistance`\n       How early to start rendering rows before they come on screen, in\n       pixels.\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example, passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `stickySectionHeadersEnabled`\n       Makes the sections headers sticky. The sticky behavior means that it will scroll with the\n       content at the top of the section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it\n       will stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section header. This\n       property is not supported in conjunction with `horizontal={true}`. Only enabled by default\n       on iOS because of typical platform standards.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `zoomScale`\n       The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.\n","title":"ListViewProps_required","info":{"arguments":[["optional",null]],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["dataSource",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"ListViewDataSource"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["renderRow",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect","Uncurried"],"EffectFn4"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Foreign"],"Foreign"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic"],"JSX"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"optional"}]}]}},"sourceSpan":{"start":[5282,1],"name":"/Users/dtwhitney/development/purescript/purescript-react-basic-native/src/React/Basic/Native/Generated.purs","end":[5286,4]}},{"children":[],"comments":"see <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/listview.html#props>\n- `accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `dataSource`\n       An instance of [ListView.DataSource](docs/listviewdatasource.html) to use\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `enableEmptySections`\n       Flag indicating whether empty section headers should be rendered.\n       In the future release empty section headers will be rendered by\n       default, and the flag will be deprecated. If empty sections are not\n       desired to be rendered their indices should be excluded from\n       sectionID object.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row\n       instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `initialListSize`\n       How many rows to render on initial component mount.  Use this to make\n       it so that the first screen worth of data apears at one time instead of\n       over the course of multiple frames.\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onChangeVisibleRows`\n       (visibleRows, changedRows) => void\n       Called when the set of visible rows changes.  `visibleRows` maps\n       { sectionID: { rowID: true }} for all the visible rows, and\n       `changedRows` maps { sectionID: { rowID: true | false }} for the rows\n       that have changed their visibility, with true indicating visible, and\n       false indicating the view has moved out of view.\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onEndReached`\n       Called when all rows have been rendered and the list has been scrolled\n       to within onEndReachedThreshold of the bottom.  The native scroll\n       event is provided.\n- `onEndReachedThreshold`\n       Threshold in pixels for onEndReached.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pageSize`\n       Number of rows to render per event loop.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       A performance optimization for improving scroll perf of\n       large lists, used in conjunction with overflow: 'hidden' on the row\n       containers.  Use at your own risk.\n- `renderFooter`\n       () => renderable\n       The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)\n       on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them\n       in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always\n       at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.\n- `renderHeader`\n       () => renderable\n       The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)\n       on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them\n       in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always\n       at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.\n- `renderRow`\n       (rowData, sectionID, rowID) => renderable\n       Takes a data entry from the data source and its ids and should return\n       a renderable component to be rendered as the row.  By default the data\n       is exactly what was put into the data source, but it's also possible to\n       provide custom extractors.\n- `renderScrollComponent`\n       A function that returns the scrollable component in which the list rows are rendered.\n       Defaults to returning a ScrollView with the given props.\n- `renderSectionHeader`\n       (sectionData, sectionID) => renderable\n       If provided, a sticky header is rendered for this section.  The sticky\n       behavior means that it will scroll with the content at the top of the\n       section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it will\n       stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section\n       header.\n- `renderSeparator`\n       (sectionID, rowID, adjacentRowHighlighted) => renderable\n       If provided, a renderable component to be rendered as the separator below each row\n       but not the last row if there is a section header below.\n       Take a sectionID and rowID of the row above and whether its adjacent row is highlighted.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollRenderAheadDistance`\n       How early to start rendering rows before they come on screen, in\n       pixels.\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example, passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `stickySectionHeadersEnabled`\n       Makes the sections headers sticky. The sticky behavior means that it will scroll with the\n       content at the top of the section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it\n       will stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section header. This\n       property is not supported in conjunction with `horizontal={true}`. Only enabled by default\n       on iOS because of typical platform standards.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `zoomScale`\n       The current scale of the scroll view content.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardVerticalOffset`\n       This is the distance between the top of the user screen and the react native view,\n       may be non-zero in some use cases.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters.

By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `columnWrapperStyle`\n       Optional custom style for multi-item rows generated when numColumns > 1\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `data`\n       For simplicity, data is just a plain array. If you want to use something else,\n       like an immutable list, use the underlying VirtualizedList directly.\n- `debug`\n       `debug` will turn on extra logging and visual overlays to aid with debugging both usage and\n       implementation, but with a significant perf hit.\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `disableVirtualization`\n       DEPRECATED: Virtualization provides significant performance and memory optimizations, but fully\n       unmounts react instances that are outside of the render window. You should only need to disable\n       this for debugging purposes.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `extraData`\n       A marker property for telling the list to re-render (since it implements PureComponent).\n       If any of your `renderItem`, Header, Footer, etc. functions depend on anything outside of the `data` prop,\n       stick it here and treat it immutably.\n- `getItem`\n       A generic accessor for extracting an item from any sort of data blob.\n- `getItemCount`\n       Determines how many items are in the data blob.\n- `getItemLayout`\n       `getItemLayout` is an optional optimization that lets us skip measurement of dynamic\n       content if you know the height of items a priori. getItemLayout is the most efficient,\n       and is easy to use if you have fixed height items, for example:\n       ```\n            * getItemLayout={(data, index) => (\n            *   {length: ITEM_HEIGHT, offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index, index}\n            * )}\n            * ```\n       Remember to include separator length (height or width) in your offset calculation if you specify\n       `ItemSeparatorComponent`.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       If true, renders items next to each other horizontally instead of stacked vertically.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `initialNumToRender`\n       How many items to render in the initial batch\n- `initialScrollIndex`\n       Instead of starting at the top with the first item, start at initialScrollIndex\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `inverted`\n       Reverses the direction of scroll. Uses scale transforms of -1.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyExtractor`\n       Used to extract a unique key for a given item at the specified index. Key is used for caching\n       and as the react key to track item re-ordering. The default extractor checks `item.key`, then\n       falls back to using the index, like React does.\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `legacyImplementation`\n       Uses legacy MetroListView instead of default VirtualizedSectionList\n- `maxToRenderPerBatch`\n       The maximum number of items to render in each incremental render batch. The more rendered at\n       once, the better the fill rate, but responsiveness my suffer because rendering content may\n       interfere with responding to button taps or other interactions.\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `numColumns`\n       Multiple columns can only be rendered with `horizontal={false}` and will zig-zag like a `flexWrap` layout.\n       Items should all be the same height - masonry layouts are not supported.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onEndReached`\n       Called once when the scroll position gets within onEndReachedThreshold of the rendered content.\n- `onEndReachedThreshold`\n       How far from the end (in units of visible length of the list) the bottom edge of the\n       list must be from the end of the content to trigger the `onEndReached` callback.\n       Thus a value of 0.5 will trigger `onEndReached` when the end of the content is\n       within half the visible length of the list.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onRefresh`\n       If provided, a standard RefreshControl will be added for \"Pull to Refresh\" functionality.\n       Make sure to also set the refreshing prop correctly.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onScrollToIndexFailed`\n       Used to handle failures when scrolling to an index that has not been measured yet.\n       Recommended action is to either compute your own offset and `scrollTo` it, or scroll as far\n       as possible and then try again after more items have been rendered.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onViewableItemsChanged`\n       Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the `viewablePercentThreshold` prop.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progressViewOffset`\n       Set this when offset is needed for the loading indicator to show correctly.\n        __*platform* android\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `refreshing`\n       Set this true while waiting for new data from a refresh.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       Note: may have bugs (missing content) in some circumstances - use at your own risk.\n       This may improve scroll performance for large lists.\n- `renderItem`\n       Takes an item from data and renders it into the list. Typical usage:\n       ```\n            * _renderItem = ({item}) => (\n            *   <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => this._onPress(item)}>\n            *     <Text>{item.title}</Text>\n            *   <TouchableOpacity/>\n            * );\n            * ...\n            * <FlatList data={[{title: 'Title Text', key: 'item1'}]} renderItem={this._renderItem} />\n            * ```\n       Provides additional metadata like `index` if you need it.\n- `renderScrollComponent`\n       Render a custom scroll component, e.g. with a differently styled `RefreshControl`.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `updateCellsBatchingPeriod`\n       Amount of time between low-pri item render batches, e.g. for rendering items quite a ways off\n       screen. Similar fill rate/responsiveness tradeoff as `maxToRenderPerBatch`.\n- `viewabilityConfig`\n       See `ViewabilityHelper` for flow type and further documentation.\n- `windowSize`\n       Determines the maximum number of items rendered outside of the visible area, in units of\n       visible lengths. So if your list fills the screen, then `windowSize={21}` (the default) will\n       render the visible screen area plus up to 10 screens above and 10 below the viewport. Reducing\n       this number will reduce memory consumption and may improve performance, but will increase the\n       chance that fast scrolling may reveal momentary blank areas of unrendered content.\n- `zoomScale`\n       The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.\n","title":"FlatListProps_required","info":{"arguments":[["itemT",null],["optional",null]],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["data",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"itemT"}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["renderItem",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect","Uncurried"],"EffectFn1"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"ListRenderItemInfo"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"itemT"}]}}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic"],"JSX"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"optional"}]}]}},"sourceSpan":{"start":[3245,1],"name":"/Users/dtwhitney/development/purescript/purescript-react-basic-native/src/React/Basic/Native/Generated.purs","end":[3249,4]}},{"children":[],"comments":"- `ItemSeparatorComponent`\n       Rendered in between each item, but not at the top or bottom\n- `ListEmptyComponent`\n       Rendered when the list is empty.\n- `ListFooterComponent`\n       Rendered at the very end of the list.\n- `ListHeaderComponent`\n       Rendered at the very beginning of the list.\n- `accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `columnWrapperStyle`\n       Optional custom style for multi-item rows generated when numColumns > 1\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `data`\n       For simplicity, data is just a plain array. If you want to use something else,\n       like an immutable list, use the underlying VirtualizedList directly.\n- `debug`\n       `debug` will turn on extra logging and visual overlays to aid with debugging both usage and\n       implementation, but with a significant perf hit.\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `disableVirtualization`\n       DEPRECATED: Virtualization provides significant performance and memory optimizations, but fully\n       unmounts react instances that are outside of the render window. You should only need to disable\n       this for debugging purposes.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `extraData`\n       A marker property for telling the list to re-render (since it implements PureComponent).\n       If any of your `renderItem`, Header, Footer, etc. functions depend on anything outside of the `data` prop,\n       stick it here and treat it immutably.\n- `getItem`\n       A generic accessor for extracting an item from any sort of data blob.\n- `getItemCount`\n       Determines how many items are in the data blob.\n- `getItemLayout`\n       `getItemLayout` is an optional optimization that lets us skip measurement of dynamic\n       content if you know the height of items a priori. getItemLayout is the most efficient,\n       and is easy to use if you have fixed height items, for example:\n       ```\n            * getItemLayout={(data, index) => (\n            *   {length: ITEM_HEIGHT, offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index, index}\n            * )}\n            * ```\n       Remember to include separator length (height or width) in your offset calculation if you specify\n       `ItemSeparatorComponent`.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       If true, renders items next to each other horizontally instead of stacked vertically.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `initialNumToRender`\n       How many items to render in the initial batch\n- `initialScrollIndex`\n       Instead of starting at the top with the first item, start at initialScrollIndex\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `inverted`\n       Reverses the direction of scroll. Uses scale transforms of -1.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyExtractor`\n       Used to extract a unique key for a given item at the specified index. Key is used for caching\n       and as the react key to track item re-ordering. The default extractor checks `item.key`, then\n       falls back to using the index, like React does.\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `legacyImplementation`\n       Uses legacy MetroListView instead of default VirtualizedSectionList\n- `maxToRenderPerBatch`\n       The maximum number of items to render in each incremental render batch. The more rendered at\n       once, the better the fill rate, but responsiveness my suffer because rendering content may\n       interfere with responding to button taps or other interactions.\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `numColumns`\n       Multiple columns can only be rendered with `horizontal={false}` and will zig-zag like a `flexWrap` layout.\n       Items should all be the same height - masonry layouts are not supported.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onEndReached`\n       Called once when the scroll position gets within onEndReachedThreshold of the rendered content.\n- `onEndReachedThreshold`\n       How far from the end (in units of visible length of the list) the bottom edge of the\n       list must be from the end of the content to trigger the `onEndReached` callback.\n       Thus a value of 0.5 will trigger `onEndReached` when the end of the content is\n       within half the visible length of the list.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onRefresh`\n       If provided, a standard RefreshControl will be added for \"Pull to Refresh\" functionality.\n       Make sure to also set the refreshing prop correctly.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onScrollToIndexFailed`\n       Used to handle failures when scrolling to an index that has not been measured yet.\n       Recommended action is to either compute your own offset and `scrollTo` it, or scroll as far\n       as possible and then try again after more items have been rendered.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onViewableItemsChanged`\n       Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the `viewablePercentThreshold` prop.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progressViewOffset`\n       Set this when offset is needed for the loading indicator to show correctly.\n        __*platform* android\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `refreshing`\n       Set this true while waiting for new data from a refresh.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       Note: may have bugs (missing content) in some circumstances - use at your own risk.\n       This may improve scroll performance for large lists.\n- `renderItem`\n       Takes an item from data and renders it into the list. Typical usage:\n       ```\n            * _renderItem = ({item}) => (\n            *   <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => this._onPress(item)}>\n            *     <Text>{item.title}</Text>\n            *   <TouchableOpacity/>\n            * );\n            * ...\n            * <FlatList data={[{title: 'Title Text', key: 'item1'}]} renderItem={this._renderItem} />\n            * ```\n       Provides additional metadata like `index` if you need it.\n- `renderScrollComponent`\n       Render a custom scroll component, e.g. with a differently styled `RefreshControl`.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `updateCellsBatchingPeriod`\n       Amount of time between low-pri item render batches, e.g. for rendering items quite a ways off\n       screen. Similar fill rate/responsiveness tradeoff as `maxToRenderPerBatch`.\n- `viewabilityConfig`\n       See `ViewabilityHelper` for flow type and further documentation.\n- `windowSize`\n       Determines the maximum number of items rendered outside of the visible area, in units of\n       visible lengths. So if your list fills the screen, then `windowSize={21}` (the default) will\n       render the visible screen area plus up to 10 screens above and 10 below the viewport. Reducing\n       this number will reduce memory consumption and may improve performance, but will increase the\n       chance that fast scrolling may reveal momentary blank areas of unrendered content.\n- `zoomScale`\n       The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.\n","title":"FlatListProps_optional","info":{"arguments":[["itemT",null]],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["ItemSeparatorComponent",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic"],"JSX"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["ListEmptyComponent",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic"],"JSX"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["ListFooterComponent",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic"],"JSX"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["ListHeaderComponent",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic"],"JSX"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityActions",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityComponentType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityElementsHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityHint",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLabel",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLiveRegion",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityRole",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityStates",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityTraits",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityViewIsModal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessible",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["alwaysBounceHorizontal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["alwaysBounceVertical",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["automaticallyAdjustContentInsets",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["bounces",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["bouncesZoom",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["canCancelContentTouches",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["centerContent",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["collapsable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["columnWrapperStyle",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","DOM","Internal"],"CSS"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentContainerStyle",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","DOM","Internal"],"CSS"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentInset",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentOffset",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"PointPropType"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["debug",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["decelerationRate",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConst

If you want to set the opacity of the drawer, use rgba.\n       Example:\n       return (\n          <DrawerLayoutAndroid drawerBackgroundColor=\"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\">\n          </DrawerLayoutAndroid>\n       );\n- `drawerLockMode`\n       Specifies the lock mode of the drawer. The drawer can be locked\n       in 3 states:\n       - unlocked (default), meaning that the drawer will respond\n          (open/close) to touch gestures.\n       - locked-closed, meaning that the drawer will stay closed and not\n          respond to gestures.\n       - locked-open, meaning that the drawer will stay opened and\n          not respond to gestures. The drawer may still be opened and\n          closed programmatically (openDrawer/closeDrawer).\n- `drawerPosition`\n       Specifies the side of the screen from which the drawer will slide in.\n       enum(DrawerLayoutAndroid.positions.Left, DrawerLayoutAndroid.positions.Right)\n- `drawerWidth`\n       Specifies the width of the drawer, more precisely the width of the\n       view that be pulled in from the edge of the window.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n       - 'none' (the default), drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n       - 'on-drag', the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onDrawerClose`\n       Function called whenever the navigation view has been closed.\n- `onDrawerOpen`\n       Function called whenever the navigation view has been opened.\n- `onDrawerSlide`\n       Function called whenever there is an interaction with the navigation view.\n- `onDrawerStateChanged`\n       Function called when the drawer state has changed.\n       The drawer can be in 3 states:\n       - idle, meaning there is no interaction with the navigation\n          view happening at the time\n       - dragging, meaning there is currently an interaction with the\n          navigation view\n       - settling, meaning that there was an interaction with the\n          navigation view, and the navigation view is now finishing\n          it's closing or opening animation\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderNavigationView`\n       The navigation view that will be rendered to the side of the\n       screen and can be pulled in.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `statusBarBackgroundColor`\n       Make the drawer take the entire screen and draw the background of\n       the status bar to allow it to open over the status bar. It will\n       only have an effect on API 21+.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `drawerBackgroundColor`\n       Specifies the background color of the drawer. The default value\n       is white. If you want to set the opacity of the drawer, use rgba.\n       Example:\n       return (\n          <DrawerLayoutAndroid drawerBackgroundColor=\"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\">\n          </DrawerLayoutAndroid>\n       );\n- `drawerLockMode`\n       Specifies the lock mode of the drawer. The drawer can be locked\n       in 3 states:\n       - unlocked (default), meaning that the drawer will respond\n          (open/close) to touch gestures.\n       - locked-closed, meaning that the drawer will stay closed and not\n          respond to gestures.\n       - locked-open, meaning that the drawer will stay opened and\n          not respond to gestures.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n       - 'none' (the default), drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n       - 'on-drag', the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onDrawerClose`\n       Function called whenever the navigation view has been closed.\n- `onDrawerOpen`\n       Function called whenever the navigation view has been opened.\n- `onDrawerSlide`\n       Function called whenever there is an interaction with the navigation view.\n- `onDrawerStateChanged`\n       Function called when the drawer state has changed.\n       The drawer can be in 3 states:\n       - idle, meaning there is no interaction with the navigation\n          view happening at the time\n       - dragging, meaning there is currently an interaction with the\n          navigation view\n       - settling, meaning that there was an interaction with the\n          navigation view, and the navigation view is now finishing\n          it's closing or opening animation\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderNavigationView`\n       The navigation view that will be rendered to the side of the\n       screen and can be pulled in.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `statusBarBackgroundColor`\n       Make the drawer take the entire screen and draw the background of\n       the status bar to allow it to open over the status bar. It will\n       only have an effect on API 21+.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is

code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onDateChange`\n       Date change handler.\n       This is called when the user changes the date or time in the UI.\n       The first and only argument is a Date object representing the new date and time.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `timeZoneOffsetInMinutes`\n       Timezone offset in minutes.\n       By default, the date picker will use the device's timezone. With this parameter, it is possible to force a certain timezone offset.\n       For instance, to show times in Pacific Standard Time, pass -7 * 60.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `date`\n       The currently selected date.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `locale`\n       The date picker locale.\n- `maximumDate`\n       Maximum date.\n       Restricts the range of possible

interval at which minutes can be selected.\n- `mode`\n       enum('date', 'time', 'datetime')\n       The date picker mode.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onDateChange`\n       Date change handler.\n       This is called when the user changes the date or time in the UI.\n       The first and only argument is a Date object representing the new date and time.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make

`accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `disabled`\n       If true the user won't be able to toggle the checkbox. Default value is false.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onChange`\n       Used in case the props change removes the component.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Invoked with the new value when the value changes.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `size`\n       Size of the indicator.\n       Small has a height of 20, large has a height of 36.\n       enum('small', 'large')\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `animating`\n       Whether to show the indicator (true, the default) or hide it (false).\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `color`\n       The foreground color of the spinner (default is gray).\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hidesWhenStopped`\n       Whether the indicator should hide when not animating (true by default).\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `size`\n       Size of the indicator.\n       Small has a height of 20, large has a height of 36.\n       enum('small', 'large')\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `animating`\n       Whether to show the indicator (true, the default) or hide it (false).\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `color`\n       The foreground color of the spinner (default is gray).\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hidesWhenStopped`\n       Whether the indicator should hide when not animating (true by default).\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `size`\n       Size of the indicator.\n       Small has a height of 20, large has a height of 36.\n       enum('small', 'large')\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `size`\n       Size of the indicator.\n       Small has a height of 20, large has a height of 36.\n       enum('small', 'large')\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onChange`\n       Used in case the props change removes the component.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Invoked with the new value when the value changes.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `value`\n       The value of the checkbox. If true the checkbox will be turned on. Default value is false.\n","title":"CheckBoxProps","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityActions",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityComponentType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityElementsHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityHint",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLabel",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLiveRegion",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityRole",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityStates",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityTraits",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityViewIsModal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessible",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["collapsable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["disabled",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hasTVPreferredFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hitSlop",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["importantForAccessibility",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["isTVSelectable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["nativeID",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onAccessibilityAction",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onAccessibilityTap",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onChange",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect","Uncurried"],"EffectFn1"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onLayout",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect","Uncurried"],"EffectFn1"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"LayoutChangeEvent"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onMagicTap",{"an

`accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `date`\n       The currently selected date.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `locale`\n       The date picker locale.\n- `maximumDate`\n       Maximum date.\n       Restricts the range of possible date/time values.\n- `minimumDate`\n       Maximum date.\n       Restricts the range of possible date/time values.\n- `minuteInterval`\n       enum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30)\n       The interval at which minutes can be selected.\n- `mode`\n       enum('date', 'time', 'datetime')\n       The date picker mode.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onDateChange`\n       Date change handler.\n       This is called when the user changes the date or time in the UI.\n       The first and only argument is a Date object representing the new date and time.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `timeZoneOffsetInMinutes`\n       Timezone offset in minutes.\n       By default, the date picker will use the device's timezone. With this parameter, it is possible to force a certain timezone offset.\n       For instance, to show times in Pacific Standard Time, pass -7 * 60.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

`accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `date`\n       The currently selected date.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `locale`\n       The date picker locale.\n- `maximumDate`\n       Maximum date.\n       Restricts the range of possible date/time values.\n- `minimumDate`\n       Maximum date.\n       Restricts the range of possible date/time values.\n- `minuteInterval`\n       enum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30)\n       The interval at which minutes can be selected.\n- `mode`\n       enum('date', 'time', 'datetime')\n       The date picker mode.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onDateChange`\n       Date change handler.\n       This is called when the user changes the date or time in the UI.\n       The first and only argument is a Date object representing the new date and time.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `timeZoneOffsetInMinutes`\n       Timezone offset in minutes.\n       By default, the date picker will use the device's timezone. With this parameter, it is possible to force a certain timezone offset.\n       For instance, to show times in Pacific Standard Time, pass -7 * 60.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

The default value\n       is white. If you want to set the opacity of the drawer, use rgba.\n       Example:\n       return (\n          <DrawerLayoutAndroid drawerBackgroundColor=\"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\">\n          </DrawerLayoutAndroid>\n       );\n- `drawerLockMode`\n       Specifies the lock mode of the drawer. The drawer can be locked\n       in 3 states:\n       - unlocked (default), meaning that the drawer will respond\n          (open/close) to touch gestures.\n       - locked-closed, meaning that the drawer will stay closed and not\n          respond to gestures.\n       - locked-open, meaning that the drawer will stay opened and\n          not respond to gestures. The drawer may still be opened and\n          closed programmatically (openDrawer/closeDrawer).\n- `drawerPosition`\n       Specifies the side of the screen from which the drawer will slide in.\n       enum(DrawerLayoutAndroid.positions.Left, DrawerLayoutAndroid.positions.Right)\n- `drawerWidth`\n       Specifies the width of the drawer, more precisely the width of the\n       view that be pulled in from the edge of the window.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n       - 'none' (the default), drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n       - 'on-drag', the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onDrawerClose`\n       Function called whenever the navigation view has been closed.\n- `onDrawerOpen`\n       Function called whenever the navigation view has been opened.\n- `onDrawerSlide`\n       Function called whenever there is an interaction with the navigation view.\n- `onDrawerStateChanged`\n       Function called when the drawer state has changed.\n       The drawer can be in 3 states:\n       - idle, meaning there is no interaction with the navigation\n          view happening at the time\n       - dragging, meaning there is currently an interaction with the\n          navigation view\n       - settling, meaning that there was an interaction with the\n          navigation view, and the navigation view is now finishing\n          it's closing or opening animation\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderNavigationView`\n       The navigation view that will be rendered to the side of the\n       screen and can be pulled in.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed.

The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `statusBarBackgroundColor`\n       Make the drawer take the entire screen and draw the background of\n       the status bar to allow it to open over the status bar. It will\n       only have an effect on API 21+.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

__*see* DrawerLayoutAndroid.android.js\n- `accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `drawerBackgroundColor`\n       Specifies the background color of the drawer. The default value\n       is white. If you want to set the opacity of the drawer, use rgba.\n       Example:\n       return (\n          <DrawerLayoutAndroid drawerBackgroundColor=\"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)\">\n          </DrawerLayoutAndroid>\n       );\n- `drawerLockMode`\n       Specifies the lock mode of the drawer. The drawer can be locked\n       in 3 states:\n       - unlocked (default), meaning that the drawer will respond\n          (open/close) to touch gestures.\n       - locked-closed, meaning that the drawer will stay closed and not\n          respond to gestures.\n       - locked-open, meaning that the drawer will stay opened and\n          not respond to gestures. The drawer may still be opened and\n          closed programmatically (openDrawer/closeDrawer).\n- `drawerPosition`\n       Specifies the side of the screen from which the drawer will slide in.\n       enum(DrawerLayoutAndroid.positions.Left, DrawerLayoutAndroid.positions.Right)\n- `drawerWidth`\n       Specifies the width of the drawer, more precisely the width of the\n       view that be pulled in from the edge of the window.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n       - 'none' (the default), drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n       - 'on-drag', the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onDrawerClose`\n       Function called whenever the navigation view has been closed.\n- `onDrawerOpen`\n       Function called whenever the navigation view has been opened.\n- `onDrawerSlide`\n       Function called whenever there is an interaction with the navigation view.\n- `onDrawerStateChanged`\n       Function called when the drawer state has changed.\n       The drawer can be in 3 states:\n       - idle, meaning there is no interaction with the navigation\n          view happening at the time\n       - dragging, meaning there is currently an interaction with the\n          navigation view\n       - settling, meaning that there was an interaction with the\n          navigation view, and the navigation view is now finishing\n          it's closing or opening animation\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderNavigationView`\n       The navigation view that will be rendered to the side of the\n       screen and can be pulled in.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `statusBarBackgroundColor`\n       Make the drawer take the entire screen and draw the background of\n       the status bar to allow it to open over the status bar. It will\n       only have an effect on API 21+.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `columnWrapperStyle`\n       Optional custom style for multi-item rows generated when numColumns > 1\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `data`\n       For simplicity, data is just a plain array. If you want to use something else,\n       like an immutable list, use the underlying VirtualizedList directly.\n- `debug`\n       `debug` will turn on extra logging and visual overlays to aid with debugging both usage and\n       implementation, but with a significant perf hit.\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `disableVirtualization`\n       DEPRECATED: Virtualization provides significant performance and memory optimizations, but fully\n       unmounts react instances that are outside of the render window. You should only need to disable\n       this for debugging purposes.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `extraData`\n       A marker property for telling the list to re-render (since it implements PureComponent).\n       If any of your `renderItem`, Header, Footer, etc. functions depend on anything outside of the `data` prop,\n       stick it here and treat it immutably.\n- `getItem`\n       A generic accessor for extracting an item from any sort of data blob.\n- `getItemCount`\n       Determines how many items are in the data blob.\n- `getItemLayout`\n       `getItemLayout` is an optional optimization that lets us skip measurement of dynamic\n       content if you know the height of items a priori. getItemLayout is the most efficient,\n       and is easy to use if you have fixed height items, for example:\n       ```\n            * getItemLayout={(data, index) => (\n            *   {length: ITEM_HEIGHT, offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index, index}\n            * )}\n            * ```\n       Remember to include separator length (height or width) in your offset calculation if you specify\n       `ItemSeparatorComponent`.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       If true, renders items next to each other horizontally instead of stacked vertically.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `initialNumToRender`\n       How many items to render in the initial batch\n- `initialScrollIndex`\n       Instead of starting at the top with the first item, start at initialScrollIndex\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `inverted`\n       Reverses the direction of scroll. Uses scale transforms of -1.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyExtractor`\n       Used to extract a unique key for a given item at the specified index. Key is used for caching\n       and as the react key to track item re-ordering. The default extractor checks `item.key`, then\n       falls back to using the index, like React does.\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `legacyImplementation`\n       Uses legacy MetroListView instead of default VirtualizedSectionList\n- `maxToRenderPerBatch`\n       The maximum number of items to render in each incremental render batch. The more rendered at\n       once, the better the fill rate, but responsiveness my suffer because rendering content may\n       interfere with responding to button taps or other interactions.\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `numColumns`\n       Multiple columns can only be rendered with `horizontal={false}` and will zig-zag like a `flexWrap` layout.\n       Items should all be the same height - masonry layouts are not supported.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onEndReached`\n       Called once when the scroll position gets within onEndReachedThreshold of the rendered content.\n- `onEndReachedThreshold`\n       How far from the end (in units of visible length of the list) the bottom edge of the\n       list must be from the end of the content to trigger the `onEndReached` callback.\n       Thus a value of 0.5 will trigger `onEndReached` when the end of the content is\n       within half the visible length of the list.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onRefresh`\n       If provided, a standard RefreshControl will be added for \"Pull to Refresh\" functionality.\n       Make sure to also set the refreshing prop correctly.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onScrollToIndexFailed`\n       Used to handle failures when scrolling to an index that has not been measured yet.\n       Recommended action is to either compute your own offset and `scrollTo` it, or scroll as far\n       as possible and then try again after more items have been rendered.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onViewableItemsChanged`\n       Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the `viewablePercentThreshold` prop.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progressViewOffset`\n       Set this when offset is needed for the loading indicator to show correctly.\n        __*platform* android\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `refreshing`\n       Set this true while waiting for new data from a refresh.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       Note: may have bugs (missing content) in some circumstances - use at your own risk.\n       This may improve scroll performance for large lists.\n- `renderItem`\n       Takes an item from data and renders it into the list. Typical usage:\n       ```\n            * _renderItem = ({item}) => (\n            *   <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => this._onPress(item)}>\n            *     <Text>{item.title}</Text>\n            *   <TouchableOpacity/>\n            * );\n            * ...\n            * <FlatList data={[{title: 'Title Text', key: 'item1'}]} renderItem={this._renderItem} />\n            * ```\n       Provides additional metadata like `index` if you need it.\n- `renderScrollComponent`\n       Render a custom scroll component, e.g. with a differently styled `RefreshControl`.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `updateCellsBatchingPeriod`\n       Amount of time between low-pri item render batches, e.g. for rendering items quite a ways off\n       screen. Similar fill rate/responsiveness tradeoff as `maxToRenderPerBatch`.\n- `viewabilityConfig`\n       See `ViewabilityHelper` for flow type and further documentation.\n- `windowSize`\n       Determines the maximum number of items rendered outside of the visible area, in units of\n       visible lengths. So if your list fills the screen, then `windowSize={21}` (the default) will\n       render the visible screen area plus up to 10 screens above and 10 below the viewport. Reducing\n       this number will reduce memory consumption and may improve performance, but will increase the\n       chance that fast scrolling may reveal momentary blank areas of unrendered content.\n- `zoomScale`\n       The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is

`ItemSeparatorComponent`\n       Rendered in between each item, but not at the top or bottom\n- `ListEmptyComponent`\n       Rendered when the list is empty.\n- `ListFooterComponent`\n       Rendered at the very end of the list.\n- `ListHeaderComponent`\n       Rendered at the very beginning of the list.\n- `accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `columnWrapperStyle`\n       Optional custom style for multi-item rows generated when numColumns > 1\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `data`\n       For simplicity, data is just a plain array. If you want to use something else,\n       like an immutable list, use the underlying VirtualizedList directly.\n- `debug`\n       `debug` will turn on extra logging and visual overlays to aid with debugging both usage and\n       implementation, but with a significant perf hit.\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `disableVirtualization`\n       DEPRECATED: Virtualization provides significant performance and memory optimizations, but fully\n       unmounts react instances that are outside of the render window. You should only need to disable\n       this for debugging purposes.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `extraData`\n       A marker property for telling the list to re-render (since it implements PureComponent).\n       If any of your `renderItem`, Header, Footer, etc. functions depend on anything outside of the `data` prop,\n       stick it here and treat it immutably.\n- `getItem`\n       A generic accessor for extracting an item from any sort of data blob.\n- `getItemCount`\n       Determines how many items are in the data blob.\n- `getItemLayout`\n       `getItemLayout` is an optional optimization that lets us skip measurement of dynamic\n       content if you know the height of items a priori. getItemLayout is the most efficient,\n       and is easy to use if you have fixed height items, for example:\n       ```\n            * getItemLayout={(data, index) => (\n            *   {length: ITEM_HEIGHT, offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index, index}\n            * )}\n            * ```\n       Remember to include separator length (height or width) in your offset calculation if you specify\n       `ItemSeparatorComponent`.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       If true, renders items next to each other horizontally instead of stacked vertically.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `initialNumToRender`\n       How many items to render in the initial batch\n- `initialScrollIndex`\n       Instead of starting at the top with the first item, start at initialScrollIndex\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `inverted`\n       Reverses the direction of scroll. Uses scale transforms of -1.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyExtractor`\n       Used to extract a unique key for a given item at the specified index. Key is used for caching\n       and as the react key to track item re-ordering. The default extractor checks `item.key`, then\n       falls back to using the index, like React does.\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `legacyImplementation`\n       Uses legacy MetroListView instead of default VirtualizedSectionList\n- `maxToRenderPerBatch`\n       The maximum number of items to render in each incremental render batch. The more rendered at\n       once, the better the fill rate, but responsiveness my suffer because rendering content may\n       interfere with responding to button taps or other interactions.\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `numColumns`\n       Multiple columns can only be rendered with `horizontal={false}` and will zig-zag like a `flexWrap` layout.\n       Items should all be the same height - masonry layouts are not supported.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onEndReached`\n       Called once when the scroll position gets within onEndReachedThreshold of the rendered content.\n- `onEndReachedThreshold`\n       How far from the end (in units of visible length of the list) the bottom edge of the\n       list must be from the end of the content to trigger the `onEndReached` callback.\n       Thus a value of 0.5 will trigger `onEndReached` when the end of the content is\n       within half the visible length of the list.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onRefresh`\n       If provided, a standard RefreshControl will be added for \"Pull to Refresh\" functionality.\n       Make sure to also set the refreshing prop correctly.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onScrollToIndexFailed`\n       Used to handle failures when scrolling to an index that has not been measured yet.\n       Recommended action is to either compute your own offset and `scrollTo` it, or scroll as far\n       as possible and then try again after more items have been rendered.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onViewableItemsChanged`\n       Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the `viewablePercentThreshold` prop.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progressViewOffset`\n       Set this when offset is needed for the loading indicator to show correctly.\n        __*platform* android\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `refreshing`\n       Set this true while waiting for new data from a refresh.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       Note: may have bugs (missing content) in some circumstances - use at your own risk.\n       This may improve scroll performance for large lists.\n- `renderItem`\n       Takes an item from data and renders it into the list. Typical usage:\n       ```\n            * _renderItem = ({item}) => (\n            *   <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => this._onPress(item)}>\n            *     <Text>{item.title}</Text>\n            *   <TouchableOpacity/>\n            * );\n            * ...\n            * <FlatList data={[{title: 'Title Text', key: 'item1'}]} renderItem={this._renderItem} />\n            * ```\n       Provides additional metadata like `index` if you need it.\n- `renderScrollComponent`\n       Render a custom scroll component, e.g. with a differently styled `RefreshControl`.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `updateCellsBatchingPeriod`\n       Amount of time between low-pri item render batches, e.g. for rendering items quite a ways off\n       screen. Similar fill rate/responsiveness tradeoff as `maxToRenderPerBatch`.\n- `viewabilityConfig`\n       See `ViewabilityHelper` for flow type and further documentation.\n- `windowSize`\n       Determines the maximum number of items rendered outside of the visible area, in units of\n       visible lengths. So if your list fills the screen, then `windowSize={21}` (the default) will\n       render the visible screen area plus up to 10 screens above and 10 below the viewport. Reducing\n       this number will reduce memory consumption and may improve performance, but will increase the\n       chance that fast scrolling may reveal momentary blank areas of unrendered content.\n- `zoomScale`\n       The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.\n","title":"FlatListProps_required","info":{"arguments":[["itemT",null],["optional",null]],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["data",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"itemT"}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["renderItem",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect","Uncurried"],"EffectFn1"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"ListRenderItemInfo"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"itemT"}]}}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic"],"JSX"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"optional"}]}]}},"sourceSpan":{"start":[3245,1],"name":"/Users/dtwhitney/development/purescript/purescript-react-basic-native/src/React/Basic/Native/Generated.purs","end":[3249,4]}},{"children":[],"comments":null,"title":"flatList","info":{"declType":"value","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"ForAll","contents":["itemT",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ForAll","contents":["attrs_",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ForAll","contents":["attrs",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ConstrainedType","contents":[{"constraintAnn":[],"constraintClass":[["Prim","Row"],"Union"],"constraintArgs":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"attrs"},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"attrs_"},{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"FlatListProps_optional"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"itemT"}]}}],"constraintData":null},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Function"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Record"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"FlatListProps_required"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"itemT"}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"attrs"}]}}]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic"],"JSX"]}]}]},null]},null]},null]}},"sourceSpan":{"start":[3252,1],"name":"/Users/dtwhitney/development/purescript/purescript-react-basic-native/src/React/Basic/Native/Generated.purs","end":[3256,9]}},{"children":[],"comments":null,"title":"GestureResponderEvent","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Events"],"NativeSyntheticEvent"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"NativeTouchEvent"]}]}},"sourceSpan":{"start":[3260,1],"name":"/Users/dtwhitney/development/purescript/purescript-react-basic-native/src/React/Basic/Native/Generated.purs","end":[3260,67]}},{"children":[],"comments":"- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

Defaults to `auto`.\n       - `auto`: Use heuristics to pick between `resize` and `scale`.\n       - `resize`: A software operation which changes the encoded image in memory before it\n       gets decoded. This should be used instead of `scale` when the image is much larger\n       than the view.\n       - `scale`: The image gets drawn downscaled or upscaled. Compared to `resize`, `scale` is\n       faster (usually hardware accelerated) and produces higher quality images. This\n       should be used if the image is smaller than the view.

(iOS only)\n       'center': Scale the image down so that it is completely visible,\n       if bigger than the area of the view.\n       The image will not be scaled up.\n- `source`\n       The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).\n       This prop can also contain several remote URLs, specified together with their width and height and potentially with scale/other URI arguments.\n       The native side will then choose the best uri to display based on the measured size of the image container.\n       A cache property can be added to control how networked request interacts with the local cache.\n       The currently supported formats are png, jpg, jpeg, bmp, gif, webp (Android only), psd (iOS only).\n- `testID`\n       A unique identifier for this element to be used in UI Automation testing scripts.\n- `width`\n       Required if loading images via 'uri' from drawable folder on Android.\n       Explanation:

See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `loadingIndicatorSource`\n       similarly to `source`, this property represents the resource used to render\n       the loading indicator for the image, displayed until image is ready to be\n       displayed, typically after when it got downloaded from network.\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onError`\n       Invoked on load error with {nativeEvent: {error}}\n- `onLayout`\n       onLayout function\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height} }}.\n- `onLoad`\n       Invoked when load completes successfully\n       { source: { url, height, width } }.\n- `onLoadEnd`\n       Invoked when load either succeeds or fails\n- `onLoadStart`\n       Invoked on load start\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onPartialLoad`\n       Invoked when a partial load of the image is complete. The definition of\n       what constitutes a \"partial load\" is loader specific though this is meant\n       for progressive JPEG loads.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onProgress`\n       Invoked on download progress with {nativeEvent: {loaded, total}}\n- `resizeMethod`\n       The mechanism that should be used to resize the image when the image's dimensions\n       differ from the image view's dimensions. Defaults to `auto`.\n       - `auto`: Use heuristics to pick between `resize` and `scale`.\n       - `resize`: A software operation which changes the encoded image in memory before it\n       gets decoded. This should be used instead of `scale` when the image is much larger\n       than the view.\n       - `scale`: The image gets drawn downscaled or upscaled. Compared to `resize`, `scale` is\n       faster (usually hardware accelerated) and produces higher quality images. This\n       should be used if the image is smaller than the view. It should also be used if the\n       image is slightly bigger than the view.\n       More details about `resize` and `scale` can be found at http://frescolib.org/docs/resizing-rotating.html.\n        __*platform* android\n- `resizeMode`\n       Determines how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw\n       image dimensions.\n       'cover': Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio)\n       so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal\n       to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).\n       'contain': Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio)\n       so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to\n       or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).\n       'stretch': Scale width and height independently, This may change the\n       aspect ratio of the src.\n       'repeat': Repeat the image to cover the frame of the view.\n       The image will keep it's size and aspect ratio. (iOS only)\n       'center': Scale the image down so that it is completely visible,\n       if bigger than the area of the view.\n       The image will not be scaled up.\n- `source`\n       The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).\n       This prop can also contain several remote URLs, specified together with their width and height and potentially with scale/other URI arguments.\n       The native side will then choose the best uri to display based on the measured size of the image container.\n       A cache property can be added to control how networked request interacts with the local cache.\n       The currently supported formats are png, jpg, jpeg, bmp, gif, webp (Android only), psd (iOS only).\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       A unique identifier for this element to be used in UI Automation testing scripts.\n- `width`\n       Required if loading images via 'uri' from drawable folder on Android.\n       Explanation:

Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

`accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `dataSource`\n       An instance of [ListView.DataSource](docs/listviewdatasource.html) to use\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `enableEmptySections`\n       Flag indicating whether empty section headers should be rendered.\n       In the future release empty section headers will be rendered by\n       default, and the flag will be deprecated. If empty sections are not\n       desired to be rendered their indices should be excluded from\n       sectionID object.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row\n       instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `initialListSize`\n       How many rows to render on initial component mount.  Use this to make\n       it so that the first screen worth of data apears at one time instead of\n       over the course of multiple frames.\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onChangeVisibleRows`\n       (visibleRows, changedRows) => void\n       Called when the set of visible rows changes.  `visibleRows` maps\n       { sectionID: { rowID: true }} for all the visible rows, and\n       `changedRows` maps { sectionID: { rowID: true | false }} for the rows\n       that have changed their visibility, with true indicating visible, and\n       false indicating the view has moved out of view.\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onEndReached`\n       Called when all rows have been rendered and the list has been scrolled\n       to within onEndReachedThreshold of the bottom.  The native scroll\n       event is provided.\n- `onEndReachedThreshold`\n       Threshold in pixels for onEndReached.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pageSize`\n       Number of rows to render per event loop.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       A performance optimization for improving scroll perf of\n       large lists, used in conjunction with overflow: 'hidden' on the row\n       containers.  Use at your own risk.\n- `renderFooter`\n       () => renderable\n       The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)\n       on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them\n       in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always\n       at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.\n- `renderHeader`\n       () => renderable\n       The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)\n       on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them\n       in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always\n       at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.\n- `renderRow`\n       (rowData, sectionID, rowID) => renderable\n       Takes a data entry from the data source and its ids and should return\n       a renderable component to be rendered as the row.  By default the data\n       is exactly what was put into the data source, but it's also possible to\n       provide custom extractors.\n- `renderScrollComponent`\n       A function that returns the scrollable component in which the list rows are rendered.\n       Defaults to returning a ScrollView with the given props.\n- `renderSectionHeader`\n       (sectionData, sectionID) => renderable\n       If provided, a sticky header is rendered for this section.  The sticky\n       behavior means that it will scroll with the content at the top of the\n       section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it will\n       stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section\n       header.\n- `renderSeparator`\n       (sectionID, rowID, adjacentRowHighlighted) => renderable\n       If provided, a renderable component to be rendered as the separator below each row\n       but not the last row if there is a section header below.\n       Take a sectionID and rowID of the row above and whether its adjacent row is highlighted.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollRenderAheadDistance`\n       How early to start rendering rows before they come on screen, in\n       pixels.\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example, passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `stickySectionHeadersEnabled`\n       Makes the sections headers sticky. The sticky behavior means that it will scroll with the\n       content at the top of the section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it\n       will stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section header. This\n       property is not supported in conjunction with `horizontal={true}`. Only enabled by default\n       on iOS because of typical platform standards.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `zoomScale`\n       The current scale of the scroll view content.

<https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/listview.html#props>\n- `accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `dataSource`\n       An instance of [ListView.DataSource](docs/listviewdatasource.html) to use\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `enableEmptySections`\n       Flag indicating whether empty section headers should be rendered.\n       In the future release empty section headers will be rendered by\n       default, and the flag will be deprecated. If empty sections are not\n       desired to be rendered their indices should be excluded from\n       sectionID object.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row\n       instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `initialListSize`\n       How many rows to render on initial component mount.  Use this to make\n       it so that the first screen worth of data apears at one time instead of\n       over the course of multiple frames.\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onChangeVisibleRows`\n       (visibleRows, changedRows) => void\n       Called when the set of visible rows changes.  `visibleRows` maps\n       { sectionID: { rowID: true }} for all the visible rows, and\n       `changedRows` maps { sectionID: { rowID: true | false }} for the rows\n       that have changed their visibility, with true indicating visible, and\n       false indicating the view has moved out of view.\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onEndReached`\n       Called when all rows have been rendered and the list has been scrolled\n       to within onEndReachedThreshold of the bottom.  The native scroll\n       event is provided.\n- `onEndReachedThreshold`\n       Threshold in pixels for onEndReached.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pageSize`\n       Number of rows to render per event loop.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       A performance optimization for improving scroll perf of\n       large lists, used in conjunction with overflow: 'hidden' on the row\n       containers.  Use at your own risk.\n- `renderFooter`\n       () => renderable\n       The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)\n       on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them\n       in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always\n       at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.\n- `renderHeader`\n       () => renderable\n       The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)\n       on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them\n       in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always\n       at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.\n- `renderRow`\n       (rowData, sectionID, rowID) => renderable\n       Takes a data entry from the data source and its ids and should return\n       a renderable component to be rendered as the row.  By default the data\n       is exactly what was put into the data source, but it's also possible to\n       provide custom extractors.\n- `renderScrollComponent`\n       A function that returns the scrollable component in which the list rows are rendered.\n       Defaults to returning a ScrollView with the given props.\n- `renderSectionHeader`\n       (sectionData, sectionID) => renderable\n       If provided, a sticky header is rendered for this section.  The sticky\n       behavior means that it will scroll with the content at the top of the\n       section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it will\n       stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section\n       header.\n- `renderSeparator`\n       (sectionID, rowID, adjacentRowHighlighted) => renderable\n       If provided, a renderable component to be rendered as the separator below each row\n       but not the last row if there is a section header below.\n       Take a sectionID and rowID of the row above and whether its adjacent row is highlighted.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollRenderAheadDistance`\n       How early to start rendering rows before they come on screen, in\n       pixels.\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example, passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `stickySectionHeadersEnabled`\n       Makes the sections headers sticky. The sticky behavior means that it will scroll with the\n       content at the top of the section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it\n       will stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section header. This\n       property is not supported in conjunction with `horizontal={true}`. Only enabled by default\n       on iOS because of typical platform standards.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `zoomScale`\n       The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.\n","title":"ListViewProps_required","info":{"arguments":[["optional",null]],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["dataSource",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"ListViewDataSource"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["renderRow",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect","Uncurried"],"EffectFn4"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Foreign"],"Foreign"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic"],"JSX"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"optional"}]}]}},"sourceSpan":{"start":[5282,1],"name":"/Users/dtwhitney/development/purescript/purescript-react-basic-native/src/React/Basic/Native/Generated.purs","end":[5286,4]}},{"children":[],"comments":null,"title":"listView","info":{"declType":"value","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"ForAll","contents":["attrs_",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ForAll","contents":["attrs",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ConstrainedType","contents":[{"constraintAnn":[],"constraintClass":[["Prim","Row"],"Union"],"constraintArgs":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"attrs"},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"attrs_"},{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"ListViewProps_optional"]}}],"constraintData":null},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Function"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Record"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"ListViewProps_required"]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeVar","contents":"attrs"}]}}]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic"],"JSX"]}]}]},null]},null]}},"sourceSpan":{"start":[5289,1],"name":"/Users/dtwhitney/development/purescript/purescript-react-basic-native/src/React/Basic/Native/Generated.purs","end":[5293,9]}},{"children":[],"comments":"- `accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label?

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

__*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

<https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/picker.html>\n __*see* Picker.js\n- `accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `enabled`\n       If set to false, the picker will be disabled, i.e. the user will not be able to make a\n       selection.\n        __*platform* android\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `itemStyle`\n       Style to apply to each of the item labels.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `mode`\n       On Android, specifies how to display the selection items when the user taps on the picker:\n          - 'dialog': Show a modal dialog. This is the default.\n          - 'dropdown': Shows a dropdown anchored to the picker view\n        __*platform* android\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Callback for when an item is selected. This is called with the\n       following parameters:\n       - itemValue: the value prop of the item that was selected\n       - itemPosition: the index of the selected item in this picker\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `prompt`\n       Prompt string for this picker, used on Android in dialog mode as the title of the dialog.\n        __*platform* android\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `selectedValue`\n       Value matching value of one of the items.\n       Can be a string or an integer.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `testId`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

   If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `color`\n       Color of the progress bar.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indeterminate`\n       If the progress bar will show indeterminate progress.\n       Note that this can only be false if styleAttr is Horizontal.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progress`\n       The progress value (between 0 and 1).\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `styleAttr`\n       Style of the ProgressBar. One of:\n          Horizontal\n          Normal (default)\n          Small\n          Large\n          Inverse\n          SmallInverse\n          LargeInverse\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progress`\n       The progress value (between 0 and 1).\n- `progressImage`\n       A stretchable image to display as the progress bar.\n- `progressTintColor`\n       The tint color of the progress bar itself.\n- `progressViewStyle`\n       The progress bar style.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `trackImage`\n       A stretchable image to display behind the progress bar.\n- `trackTintColor`\n       The tint color of the progress bar track.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

`accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row\n       instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       Experimental: When true offscreen child views (whose `overflow` value is\n       `hidden`) are removed from their native backing superview when offscreen.\n       This canimprove scrolling performance on long lists. The default value is\n       false.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `zoomScale`\n       The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.\n","title":"RecyclerViewBackedScrollViewProps","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityActions",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityComponentType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityElementsHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityHint",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLabel",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLiveRegion",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityRole",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityStates",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityTraits",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityViewIsModal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessible",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["alwaysBounceHorizontal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["alwaysBounceVertical",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["automaticallyAdjustContentInsets",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["bounces",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["bouncesZoom",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["canCancelContentTouches",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["centerContent",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["collapsable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentContainerStyle",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","DOM","Internal"],"CSS"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentInset",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentOffset",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"PointPropType"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["decelerationRate",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["directionalLockEnabled",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["endFillColor",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hasTVPreferredFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hitSlop",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["horizontal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["importantForAccessibility",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Pr

Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onRefresh`\n       Called when the view starts refreshing.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progressBackgroundColor`\n       The background color of the refresh indicator.\n- `progressViewOffset`\n       Progress view top offset\n        __*platform* android\n- `refreshing`\n       Whether the view should be indicating an active refresh.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `size`\n       Size of the refresh indicator, see RefreshControl.SIZE.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tintColor`\n       The color of the refresh indicator.\n- `title`\n       The title displayed under the refresh indicator.\n- `titleColor`\n       Title color.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onRefresh`\n       Called when the view starts refreshing.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `progressBackgroundColor`\n       The background color of the refresh indicator.\n- `progressViewOffset`\n       Progress view top offset\n        __*platform* android\n- `refreshing`\n       Whether the view should be indicating an active refresh.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `size`\n       Size of the refresh indicator, see RefreshControl.SIZE.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tintColor`\n       The color of the refresh indicator.\n- `title`\n       The title displayed under the refresh indicator.\n- `titleColor`\n       Title color.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `alwaysBounceHorizontal`\n       When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.\n- `alwaysBounceVertical`\n       When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end\n       even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default\n       value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.\n       The default value is true.\n- `bounces`\n       When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the\n       content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of\n       the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if\n       the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.\n- `bouncesZoom`\n       When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate\n       to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed\n       the limits.\n- `canCancelContentTouches`\n       When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.\n       The default value is true.\n- `centerContent`\n       When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the\n       content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is\n       larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default\n       value is false.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentContainerStyle`\n       These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which\n       wraps all of the child views. Example:\n          return (\n            <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>\n            </ScrollView>\n          );\n          ...\n          const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n            contentContainer: {\n              paddingVertical: 20\n            }\n          });\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`\n       This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.\n       The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.\n- `contentOffset`\n       Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.\n       The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view\n       decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include\n          - Normal: 0.998 (the default)\n          - Fast: 0.9\n- `directionalLockEnabled`\n       When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal\n       scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.\n- `endFillColor`\n       Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.\n       When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the\n       scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating\n       unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not\n       needed in the general case.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `horizontal`\n       When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row\n       instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `indicatorStyle`\n       The style of the scroll indicators.\n       - default (the default), same as black.\n       - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against\n          a white content background.\n       - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against\n          a black content background.\n- `invertStickyHeaders`\n       If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the\n       ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n          - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag\n            and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the\n            dismissal.\n- `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`\n       Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.\n       - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.\n       - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.\n       - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).\n       - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead\n       - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead\n- `maximumZoomScale`\n       The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `minimumZoomScale`\n       The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `nestedScrollEnabled`\n       Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.\n       Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)\n       It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMomentumScrollBegin`\n       Fires when scroll view has begun moving\n- `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n       Fires when scroll view has finished moving\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.\n       The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.\n- `onScrollAnimationEnd`\n       Called when a scrolling animation ends.\n- `onScrollBeginDrag`\n       Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.\n- `onScrollEndDrag`\n       Fires when a user has finished scrolling.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `overScrollMode`\n       Used to override default value of overScroll mode.\n          Possible values:\n            - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.\n            - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n            - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.\n- `pagingEnabled`\n       When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size\n       when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default\n       value is false.\n- `pinchGestureEnabled`\n       When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.\n       The default value is true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `refreshControl`\n       A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh\n       functionality for the ScrollView.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       Experimental: When true offscreen child views (whose `overflow` value is\n       `hidden`) are removed from their native backing superview when offscreen.\n       This canimprove scrolling performance on long lists. The default value is\n       false.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true\n- `scrollEventThrottle`\n       This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).\n       A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,\n       but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.\n       The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.\n- `scrollIndicatorInsets`\n       The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.\n       This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.\n       Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.\n- `scrollPerfTag`\n       Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force\n       momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do\n       anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native\n       FpsListener for it to be useful.\n        __*platform* android\n- `scrollsToTop`\n       When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.\n- `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`\n       When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.\n- `snapToAlignment`\n       When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.\n             - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)\n             - `center` will align the snap in the center\n             - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)\n- `snapToEnd`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap\n       offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely\n       between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `snapToInterval`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.\n       This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less\n       configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.\n- `snapToOffsets`\n       When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for\n       paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.\n       Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate=\"fast\"`. Overrides less configurable\n       `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.\n- `snapToStart`\n       Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a\n       snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll\n       freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.\n- `stickyHeaderIndices`\n       An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the\n       top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing\n       `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the\n       top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction\n       with `horizontal={true}`.\n- `style`\n       Style\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `enabled`\n       If false the user won't be able to interact with the control. Default value is true.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `momentary`\n       If true, then selecting a segment won't persist visually.\n       The onValueChange callback will still work as expected.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onChange`\n       Callback that is called when the user taps a segment;\n       passes the event as an argument\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Callback that is called when the user taps a segment; passes the segment's value as an argument\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `selectedIndex`\n       The index in props.values of the segment to be (pre)selected.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tintColor`\n       Accent color of the control.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `values`\n       The labels for the control's segment buttons, in order.\n","title":"SegmentedControlIOSProps","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityActions",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityComponentType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityElementsHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityHint",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLabel",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLiveRegion",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityRole",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityStates",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityTraits",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityViewIsModal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessible",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["collapsable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["enabled",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hasTVPreferredFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hitSlop",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["importantForAccessibility",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["isTVSelectable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["momentary",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["nativeID",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onAccessibilityAction",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onAccessibilityTap",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onChange",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect","Uncurried"],"EffectFn1"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Events"],"NativeSyntheticEvent"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"NativeSegmentedControlIOSChangeEvent"]}]}}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onLayout",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"Type

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `maximumTrackImage`\n       Assigns a maximum track image. Only static images are supported.\n       The leftmost pixel of the image will be stretched to fill the track.\n- `maximumTrackTintColor`\n       The color used for the track to the right of the button.\n       Overrides the default blue gradient image.\n- `maximumValue`\n       Initial maximum value of the slider. Default value is 1.\n- `minimumTrackImage`\n       Assigns a minimum track image. Only static images are supported.\n       The rightmost pixel of the image will be stretched to fill the track.\n- `minimumTrackTintColor`\n       The color used for the track to the left of the button.\n       Overrides the default blue gradient image.\n- `minimumValue`\n       Initial minimum value of the slider. Default value is 0.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onSlidingComplete`\n       Callback called when the user finishes changing the value (e.g. when the slider is released).\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Callback continuously called while the user is dragging the slider.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `step`\n       Step value of the slider. The value should be between 0 and (maximumValue - minimumValue). Default value is 0.\n- `style`\n       Used to style and layout the Slider. See StyleSheet.js and ViewStylePropTypes.js for more info.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in UI automation tests.\n- `thumbImage`\n       Sets an image for the thumb.

See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onTintColor`\n       Background color when the switch is turned on.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Callback that is called when the user toggles the switch.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `thumbTintColor`\n       Background color for the switch round button.\n- `tintColor`\n       Background color when the switch is turned off.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `value`\n       The value of the switch, if true the switch will be turned on. Default value is false.\n","title":"SwitchIOSProps","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityActions",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityComponentType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityElementsHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityHint",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLabel",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLiveRegion",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityRole",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityStates",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityTraits",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityViewIsModal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessible",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["collapsable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["disabled",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hasTVPreferredFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hitSlop",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["importantForAccessibility",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["isTVSelectable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["nativeID",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onAccessibilityAction",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onAccessibilityTap",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onLayout",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect","Uncurried"],"EffectFn1"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"LayoutChangeEvent"]}]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onMagicTap",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["onMoveShouldSetResponder",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeA

See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `ios_backgroundColor`\n       On iOS, custom color for the background.\n       Can be seen when the switch value is false or when the switch is disabled.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onTintColor`\n       Background color when the switch is turned on.\n- `onValueChange`\n       Invoked with the new value when the value changes.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `thumbColor`\n       Color of the foreground switch grip.\n- `thumbTintColor`\n       Color of the foreground switch grip.\n- `tintColor`\n       Background color when the switch is turned off.\n- `trackColor`\n       Custom colors for the switch track\n       Color when false and color when true\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `icon`\n       A custom icon for the tab. It is ignored when a system icon is defined.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onPress`\n       Callback when this tab is being selected,\n       you should change the state of your component to set selected={true}.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderAsOriginal`\n       If set to true it renders the image as original,\n       it defaults to being displayed as a template\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `selected`\n       It specifies whether the children are visible or not. If you see a blank content, you probably forgot to add a selected one.\n- `selectedIcon`\n       A custom icon when the tab is selected.\n       It is ignored when a system icon is defined. If left empty, the icon will be tinted in blue.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `style`\n       React style object.\n- `systemIcon`\n       Items comes with a few predefined system icons.\n       Note that if you are using them, the title and selectedIcon will be overriden with the system ones.\n         enum('bookmarks', 'contacts', 'downloads', 'favorites', 'featured', 'history', 'more', 'most-recent', 'most-viewed', 'recents', 'search', 'top-rated')\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `title`\n       Text that appears under the icon. It is ignored when a system icon is defined.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

`accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `barTintColor`\n       Background color of the tab bar\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `itemPositioning`\n       Specifies tab bar item positioning. Available values are:\n       - fill - distributes items across the entire width of the tab bar\n       - center - centers item in the available tab bar space\n       - auto (default) - distributes items dynamically according to the\n       user interface idiom. In a horizontally compact environment (e.g. iPhone 5)\n       this value defaults to `fill`, in a horizontally regular one (e.g. iPad)\n       it defaults to center.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tintColor`\n       Color of the currently selected tab icon\n- `translucent`\n       A Boolean value that indicates whether the tab bar is translucent\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

The default value is false.\n- `dataDetectorTypes`\n       Determines the types of data converted to clickable URLs in the text input.\n       Only valid if `multiline={true}` and `editable={false}`.\n       By default no data types are detected.\n       You can provide one type or an array of many types.\n       Possible values for `dataDetectorTypes` are:\n       - `'phoneNumber'`\n       - `'link'`\n       - `'address'`\n       - `'calendarEvent'`\n       - `'none'`\n       - `'all'`\n- `defaultValue`\n       Provides an initial value that will change when the user starts typing.\n       Useful for simple use-cases where you don't want to deal with listening to events\n       and updating the value prop to keep the controlled state in sync.\n- `disableFullscreenUI`\n       When false, if there is a small amount of space available around a text input (e.g. landscape orientation on a phone),\n          the OS may choose to have the user edit the text inside of a full screen text input mode.\n       When true, this feature is disabled and users will always edit the text directly inside of the text input.\n       Defaults to false.\n- `editable`\n       If false, text is not editable. The default value is true.\n- `enablesReturnKeyAutomatically`\n       If true, the keyboard disables the return key when there is no text and automatically enables it when there is text.\n       The default value is false.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `inlineImageLeft`\n       If defined, the provided image resource will be rendered on the left.\n- `inlineImagePadding`\n       Padding between the inline image, if any, and the text input itself.\n- `inputAccessoryViewID`\n       Used to connect to an InputAccessoryView. Not part of react-natives documentation, but present in examples and\n       code.\n       See https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/inputaccessoryview.html for more information.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardAppearance`\n       Determines the color of the keyboard.\n- `keyboardType`\n       enum(\"default\", 'numeric', 'email-address', \"ascii-capable\", 'numbers-and-punctuation', 'url', 'number-pad', 'phone-pad', 'name-phone-pad',\n       'decimal-pad', 'twitter', 'web-search', 'visible-password')\n       Determines which keyboard to open, e.g.numeric.\n       The following values work across platforms: - default - numeric - email-address - phone-pad\n       The following values work on iOS: - ascii-capable - numbers-and-punctuation - url - number-pad - name-phone-pad - decimal-pad - twitter - web-search\n       The following values work on Android: - visible-password\n- `maxFontSizeMultiplier`\n       Specifies largest possible scale a font can reach when allowFontScaling is enabled. Possible values:\n       - null/undefined (default): inherit from the parent node or the global default (0)\n       - 0: no max, ignore parent/global default\n       - >= 1: sets the maxFontSizeMultiplier of this node to this value\n- `maxLength`\n       Limits the maximum number of characters that can be entered.\n       Use this instead of implementing the logic in JS to avoid flicker.\n- `multiline`\n       If true, the text input can be multiple lines. The default value is false.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `numberOfLines`\n       Sets the number of lines for a TextInput.\n       Use it with multiline set to true to be able to fill the lines.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onBlur`\n       Callback that is called when the text input is blurred\n- `onChange`\n       Callback that is called when the text input's text changes.\n- `onChangeText`\n       Callback that is called when the text input's text changes.\n       Changed text is passed as an argument to the callback handler.\n- `onContentSizeChange`\n       Callback that is called when the text input's content size changes.\n       This will be called with\n       `{ nativeEvent: { contentSize: { width, height } } }`.\n       Only called for multiline text inputs.\n- `onEndEditing`\n       Callback that is called when text input ends.\n- `onFocus`\n       Callback that is called when the text input is focused\n- `onKeyPress`\n       Callback that is called when a key is pressed.\n       This will be called with\n         `{ nativeEvent: { key: keyValue } }`\n       where keyValue is 'Enter' or 'Backspace' for respective keys and the typed-in character otherwise including ' ' for space.\n       Fires before onChange callbacks.\n       Note: on Android only the inputs from soft keyboard are handled, not the hardware keyboard inputs.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onScroll`\n       Invoked on content scroll with\n         `{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { x, y } } }`.\n       May also contain other properties from ScrollEvent but on Android contentSize is not provided for performance reasons.\n- `onSelectionChange`\n       Callback that is called when the text input selection is changed.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onSubmitEditing`\n       Callback that is called when the text input's submit button is pressed.\n- `placeholder`\n       The string that will be rendered before text input has been entered\n- `placeholderTextColor`\n       The text color of the placeholder string\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `returnKeyLabel`\n       Sets the return key to the label. Use it instead of `returnKeyType`.\n        __*platform* android\n- `returnKeyType`\n       enum('default', 'go', 'google', 'join', 'next', 'route', 'search', 'send', 'yahoo', 'done', 'emergency-call')\n       Determines how the return key should look.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       If false, scrolling of the text view will be disabled. The default value is true. Only works with multiline={true}\n- `secureTextEntry`\n       If true, the text input obscures the text entered so that sensitive text like passwords stay secure.\n       The default value is false.\n- `selectTextOnFocus`\n       If true, all text will automatically be selected on focus\n- `selection`\n       The start and end of the text input's selection. Set start and end to\n       the same value to position the cursor.\n- `selectionColor`\n       The highlight (and cursor on ios) color of the text input\n- `selectionState`\n       See DocumentSelectionState.js, some state that is responsible for maintaining selection information for a document\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `spellCheck`\n       If false, disables spell-check style (i.e. red underlines). The default value is inherited from autoCorrect\n- `style`\n       Styles\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests\n- `textAlignVertical`\n       Vertically align text when `multiline` is set to true\n- `textBreakStrategy`\n       Set text break strategy on Android API Level 23+, possible values are simple, highQuality, balanced\n       The default value is simple.\n- `textContentType`\n       Give the keyboard and the system information about the expected\n       semantic meaning for the content that users enter.\n       For iOS 11+ you can set `textContentType` to `username` or `password` to\n       enable autofill of login details from the device keychain.\n       For iOS 12+ `newPassword` can be used to indicate a new password input the\n       user may want to save in the keychain, and `oneTimeCode` can be used to indicate\n       that a field can be autofilled by a code arriving in an SMS.\n       To disable autofill, set textContentType to `none`.\n       Possible values for `textContentType` are:\n         - `'none'`\n         - `'URL'`\n         - `'addressCity'`\n         - `'addressCityAndState'`\n         - `'addressState'`\n         - `'countryName'`\n         - `'creditCardNumber'`\n         - `'emailAddress'`\n         - `'familyName'`\n         - `'fullStreetAddress'`\n         - `'givenName'`\n         - `'jobTitle'`\n         - `'location'`\n         - `'middleName'`\n         - `'name'`\n         - `'namePrefix'`\n         - `'nameSuffix'`\n         - `'nickname'`\n         - `'organizationName'`\n         - `'postalCode'`\n         - `'streetAddressLine1'`\n         - `'streetAddressLine2'`\n         - `'sublocality'`\n         - `'telephoneNumber'`\n         - `'username'`\n         - `'password'`\n         - `'newPassword'`\n         - `'oneTimeCode'`\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `underlineColorAndroid`\n       The color of the textInput underline.\n- `value`\n       The value to show for the text input. TextInput is a controlled component,\n       which means the native value will be forced to match this value prop if provided.\n       For most uses this works great, but in some cases this may cause flickering - one common cause is preventing edits by keeping value the same.\n       In addition to simply setting the same value, either set editable={false},\n       or set/update maxLength to

Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `actions`\n       Sets possible actions on the toolbar as part of the action menu. These are displayed as icons\n       or text on the right side of the widget. If they don't fit they are placed in an 'overflow'\n       menu.\n       This property takes an array of objects, where each object has the following keys:\n       * `title`: **required**, the title of this action\n       * `icon`: the icon for this action, e.g. `require('./some_icon.png')`\n       * `show`: when to show this action as an icon or hide it in the overflow menu: `always`,\n       `ifRoom` or `never`\n       * `showWithText`: boolean, whether to show text alongside the icon or not\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentInsetEnd`\n       Sets the content inset for the toolbar ending edge.\n       The content inset affects the valid area for Toolbar content other\n       than the navigation button and menu. Insets define the minimum\n       margin for these components and can be used to effectively align\n       Toolbar content along well-known gridlines.\n- `contentInsetStart`\n       Sets the content inset for the toolbar starting edge.\n       The content inset affects the valid area for Toolbar content\n       other than the navigation button and menu. Insets define the\n       minimum margin for these components and can be used to effectively\n       align Toolbar content along well-known gridlines.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `logo`\n       Sets the toolbar logo.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `navIcon`\n       Sets the navigation icon.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onActionSelected`\n       Callback that is called when an action is selected. The only\n       argument that is passed to the callback is the position of the\n       action in the actions array.\n- `onIconClicked`\n       Callback called when the icon is selected.\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `overflowIcon`\n       Sets the overflow icon.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `rtl`\n       Used to set the toolbar direction to RTL.\n       In addition to this property you need to add\n       android:supportsRtl=\"true\"\n       to your application AndroidManifest.xml and then call\n       setLayoutDirection(LayoutDirection.RTL) in your MainActivity\n       onCreate method.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `subtitle`\n       Sets the toolbar subtitle.\n- `subtitleColor`\n       Sets the toolbar subtitle color.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `title`\n       Sets the toolbar title.\n- `titleColor`\n       Sets the toolbar title color.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

(i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `activeOpacity`\n       Determines what the opacity of the wrapped view should be when touch is active.\n- `delayLongPress`\n       Delay in ms, from onPressIn, before onLongPress is called.\n- `delayPressIn`\n       Delay in ms, from the start of the touch, before onPressIn is called.\n- `delayPressOut`\n       Delay in ms, from the release of the touch, before onPressOut is called.\n- `disabled`\n       If true, disable all interactions for this component.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* TV preferred focus (see documentation for the View component).\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far your touch can start away from the button.\n       This is added to pressRetentionOffset when moving off of the button.\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits\n       two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onBlur`\n       When `accessible` is true (which is the default) this may be called when\n       the OS-specific concept of \"blur\" occurs, meaning the element lost focus.\n       Some platforms may not have the concept of blur.\n- `onFocus`\n       When `accessible` is true (which is the default) this may be called when\n       the OS-specific concept of \"focus\" occurs. Some platforms may not have\n       the concept of focus.\n- `onHideUnderlay`\n       Called immediately after the underlay is hidden\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: {layout: {x, y, width, height}}}\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onPress`\n       Called when the touch is released,\n       but not if cancelled (e.g. by a scroll that steals the responder lock).\n- `onShowUnderlay`\n       Called immediately after the underlay is shown\n- `pressRetentionOffset`\n       When the scroll view is disabled, this defines how far your\n       touch may move off of the button, before deactivating the button.\n       Once deactivated, try moving it back and you'll see that the button\n       is once again reactivated! Move it back and forth several times\n       while the scroll view is disabled.

If property borderless evaluates to true the ripple will render\n                outside of the view bounds (see native actionbar buttons as an example of that behavior).

`accessibilityActions`\n       Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert

Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element.

A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `initialPage`\n       Index of initial page that should be selected. Use `setPage` method to\n       update the page, and `onPageSelected` to monitor page changes\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `keyboardDismissMode`\n       Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.\n          - 'none' (the default), drags do not dismiss the keyboard.\n          - 'on-drag', the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onPageScroll`\n       Executed when transitioning between pages (ether because of animation for\n       the requested page change or when user is swiping/dragging between pages)\n       The `event.nativeEvent` object for this callback will carry following data:\n         - position - index of first page from the left that is currently visible\n         - offset - value from range [0,1) describing stage between page transitions.\n           Value x means that (1 - x) fraction of the page at \"position\" index is\n           visible, and x fraction of the next page is visible.\n- `onPageScrollStateChanged`\n       Function called when the page scrolling state has changed.\n       The page scrolling state can be in 3 states:\n       - idle, meaning there is no interaction with the page scroller happening at the time\n       - dragging, meaning there is currently an interaction with the page scroller\n       - settling, meaning that there was an interaction with the page scroller, and the\n          page scroller is now finishing it's closing or opening animation\n- `onPageSelected`\n       This callback will be called once ViewPager finish navigating to selected page\n       (when user swipes between pages). The `event.nativeEvent` object passed to this\n       callback will have following fields:\n         - position - index of page that has been selected\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pageMargin`\n       Blank space to show between pages. This is only visible while scrolling, pages are still\n       edge-to-edge.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       When false, the content does not scroll.\n       The default value is true.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.

`accessibilityComponentType`\n       In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).\n       If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to\n       provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property\n       for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityElementsHidden`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element\n       are hidden to the screen reader.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityHint`\n       An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.\n- `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`\n       https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityLabel`\n       Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the\n       label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.\n- `accessibilityLiveRegion`\n       Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.\n       Works for Android API >= 19 only.\n       See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.\n        __*platform* android\n- `accessibilityRole`\n       Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.\n- `accessibilityStates`\n       Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.\n- `accessibilityTraits`\n       Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.\n       Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessibilityViewIsModal`\n       A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `accessible`\n       When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.\n       By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.\n- `allowFileAccess`\n       Sets whether the webview allows access to the file system.\n- `allowsInlineMediaPlayback`\n       Determines whether HTML5 videos play inline or use the native\n       full-screen controller. default value false\n       NOTE : \"In order * for video to play inline, not only does\n       this property need to be set to true, but the video element\n       in the HTML document must also include the webkit-playsinline\n       attribute.\"\n- `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`\n       Controls whether to adjust the content inset for web views that are\n       placed behind a navigation bar, tab bar, or toolbar. The default value\n       is `true`.\n- `bounces`\n       Boolean value that determines whether the web view bounces\n       when it reaches the edge of the content. The default value is `true`.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `collapsable`\n       Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything\n       may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.\n       Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.\n- `contentInset`\n       The amount by which the web view content is inset from the edges of\n       the scroll view. Defaults to {top: 0, left: 0, bottom: 0, right: 0}.\n- `dataDetectorTypes`\n       Determines the types of data converted to clickable URLs in\n       the web view’s content. By default only phone numbers are detected.\n       You can provide one type or an array of many types.\n       Possible values for `dataDetectorTypes` are:\n       - `'phoneNumber'`\n       - `'link'`\n       - `'address'`\n       - `'calendarEvent'`\n       - `'none'`\n       - `'all'`\n- `decelerationRate`\n       A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll\n       view decelerates after the user lifts their finger. You may also\n       use string shortcuts \"normal\" and \"fast\" which match the\n       underlying iOS settings for UIScrollViewDecelerationRateNormal\n       and UIScrollViewDecelerationRateFast respectively.\n       - normal: 0.998 - fast: 0.99 (the default for iOS WebView)\n- `domStorageEnabled`\n       Used on Android only, controls whether DOM Storage is enabled\n       or not android\n- `hasTVPreferredFocus`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `hitSlop`\n       This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.\n       Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least\n       30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has\n       a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with\n       hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}\n       NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and\n       the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch\n       hits two overlapping views.\n- `importantForAccessibility`\n       Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events\n       and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.\n       Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.\n       Possible values:\n             'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).\n             'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.\n             'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.\n             'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.\n- `injectedJavaScript`\n       Set this to provide JavaScript that will be injected into the web page\n       when the view loads.\n- `isTVSelectable`\n       *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable\n       and navigable using the Apple TV remote.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `javaScriptEnabled`\n       Used for android only, JS is enabled by default for WebView on iOS\n- `mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction`\n       Determines whether HTML5 audio & videos require the user to tap\n       before they can start playing. The default value is false.\n- `mixedContentMode`\n       Specifies the mixed content mode. i.e WebView will allow a secure origin to load content from any other origin.\n       Possible values for mixedContentMode are:\n       'never' (default) - WebView will not allow a secure origin to load content from an insecure origin.\n       'always' - WebView will allow a secure origin to load content from any other origin, even if that origin is insecure.\n       'compatibility' - WebView will attempt to be compatible with the approach of a modern web browser with regard to mixed content.\n- `nativeConfig`\n       Override the native component used to render the WebView. Enables a custom native\n       WebView which uses the same JavaScript as the original WebView.\n- `nativeID`\n       Used to reference react managed views from native code.\n- `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`\n       Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.\n       The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children\n       with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.\n       This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on\n       has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).\n       Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive\n       and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.\n       If you do need to enable this property for an animation,\n       consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).\n       If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,\n       saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.\n- `onAccessibilityAction`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function\n       when the user performs an accessibility custom action.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onAccessibilityTap`\n       When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onError`\n       Invoked when load fails\n- `onLayout`\n       Invoked on mount and layout changes with\n       {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.\n- `onLoad`\n       Invoked when load finish\n- `onLoadEnd`\n       Invoked when load either succeeds or fails\n- `onLoadStart`\n       Invoked on load start\n- `onMagicTap`\n       When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `onMessage`\n       Invoked when window.postMessage is called from WebView.\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponder`\n       Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to \"claim\" touch responsiveness?\n- `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `onNavigationStateChange`\n       Function that is invoked when the `WebView` loading starts or ends.\n- `onResponderEnd`\n       If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:\n- `onResponderGrant`\n       The View is now responding for touch events.\n       This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening\n- `onResponderMove`\n       If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:\n       The user is moving their finger\n- `onResponderReject`\n       Something else is the responder right now and will not release it\n- `onResponderRelease`\n       Fired at the end of the touch, ie \"touchUp\"\n- `onResponderTerminate`\n       The responder has been taken from the View.\n       Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,\n       or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)\n- `onResponderTerminationRequest`\n       Something else wants to become responder.\n       Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release\n- `onShouldStartLoadWithRequest`\n       Allows custom handling of any webview requests by a JS handler.\n       Return true or false from this method to continue loading the\n       request.\n- `onStartShouldSetResponder`\n       A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.\n       There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:\n       Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?\n- `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`\n       onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,\n       where the deepest node is called first.\n       That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.\n       This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.\n       However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.\n       This can be handled by using the capture phase.\n       Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,\n       it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.\n       So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,\n       it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.\n- `originWhitelist`\n       List of origin strings to allow being navigated to.\n       The strings allow wildcards and get matched against just the origin (not the full URL).\n       If the user taps to navigate to a new page but the new page is not in this whitelist, the URL will be handled by the OS.\n       The default whitelisted origins are \"http://\" and \"https://\".\n- `pointerEvents`\n       In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:\n       .box-none {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       .box-none * {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       box-only is the equivalent of\n       .box-only {\n          pointer-events: all;\n       }\n       .box-only * {\n          pointer-events: none;\n       }\n       But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,\n       we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.\n- `removeClippedSubviews`\n       This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,\n       most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.\n       The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).\n- `renderError`\n       Function that returns a view to show if there's an error.\n- `renderLoading`\n       Function that returns a loading indicator.\n- `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`\n       Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.\n       On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:\n       in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be\n       re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.\n- `saveFormDataDisabled`\n       Controls whether form autocomplete data should be saved\n- `scalesPageToFit`\n       sets whether the webpage scales to fit the view and the user can change the scale\n- `scrollEnabled`\n       Boolean value that determines whether scrolling is enabled in the\n       `WebView`. The default value is `true`.\n- `shouldRasterizeIOS`\n       Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.\n       On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;\n       for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view\n       and quickly composite it during each frame.\n       Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.\n       Test and measure when using this property.\n- `startInLoadingState`\n       Boolean value that forces the `WebView` to show the loading view\n       on the first load.\n- `testID`\n       Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.\n- `tvParallaxMagnification`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxProperties`\n       *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `tvParallaxTiltAngle`\n       *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.\n        __*platform* ios\n- `useWebKit`\n       If `true`, use WKWebView instead of UIWebView.\n- `userAgent`\n       Sets the user-agent for the WebView.\n","title":"WebViewProps","info":{"arguments":[],"declType":"typeSynonym","type":{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityActions",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityComponentType",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityElementsHidden",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityHint",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLabel",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityLiveRegion",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityRole",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityStates",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityTraits",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessibilityViewIsModal",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["accessible",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["allowFileAccess",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["allowsInlineMediaPlayback",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["automaticallyAdjustContentInsets",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["bounces",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["collapsable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["contentInset",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["dataDetectorTypes",{"annotation":[],"tag":"ParensInType","contents":{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeApp","contents":[{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Array"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]}]}},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["decelerationRate",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["domStorageEnabled",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hasTVPreferredFocus",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["hitSlop",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["React","Basic","Native","Generated"],"Insets"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["html",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["importantForAccessibility",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["injectedJavaScript",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["isTVSelectable",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["javaScriptEnabled",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"Boolean"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","contents":["mixedContentMode",{"annotation":[],"tag":"TypeConstructor","contents":[["Prim"],"String"]},{"annotation":[],"tag":"RCons","con
